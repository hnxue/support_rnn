47266.12,"Good Monday to you Glenz; by now, I am sure your head must be spinning - it is a lot to digest I am sure and by now you are probably feeling it's pretty hopeless.
  Well; I am about to provide some more information for you to read, so hang on to your garters, Gertie - No, no, stop screaming; it's all to the good - I assure you!  You okay?  Good!  We shall commence.
  Since you do not know me, I'll introduce my background.  I am an RN who has spent over 20 years as Administrator of Patient Case Management in acute hospitals which includes my managing the departments of Case Management, Discharge Planning, Social Services and Utilization Management.  I also have had a ""side"" business of auditing records for Quality Improvement and spent much time doing this for Hospice and Home Health organizations and other settings as well.
  My mother had FrontoTemporal Dementia and my step-dad and MIL were given the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.  To make an understatement, it has been interesting.
  While nothing is ever 100%; most of the following is all what actually happens in the vast majority of the time with the various Hospice organizations.  It is all okay.
  When reading the actual ""law,"" one comes away with a certain set of feelings and/or understanding; but practical application, in actual practice, can be quite, quite, different and still be within the criteria parameters.
  When Hospice has a Cancer, or Heart or COPD patient, they usually follow a very easy to define line of decline.  It is almost a black and white portrait.
  However; in dementia; this is not so.  It is all shades of gray.  The federal guidelines did not originally make plans for Hospice care in dementia - they have been caught up short.  So they tried to hash out criteria, and it has again come up short.  Also, there are different dementias which can present differently and they are not easily categorized.  Many gravely compromised dementia patients on the End-Stage slide do not fit the, ""FAST"" Criteria which is a measurement for Hospice admission.
  Hospice accommodates this by using other reasons or combined reasons with a ""softer"" admissions standard to their service.  They may use Adult Failure to Thrive, or use Debility and Decline, they may use co-morbidities, weight loss and nutrition issues, etc., or combinations of all. 
  What is done in practice, is that Hospice is much ""softer"" on admissions for dementia patients.   I have observed and experienced this for years and we have seen this here from some of our Members.
  When a patient is admitted to Hospice, they are ""Certified"" as a Hospice patient for a certain number of days - the first two Cert periods are for 90 days and all other cert periods are for 60 days.
  The admission is Certified for an initial 90 days - and the intake Hospice staff feels there will in all probability be further decline during that time period.  However, if the patient rallies, or if the patient remains stable, the patient may possibly (or not) be discharged from Hospice and can be readmitted later as the condition begins to decline and the patient requires Hospice services.
  ALSO - it is true; Hospice does indeed pay for the prescriptions for the Primary (Principle) Diagnosis (reason) for admission to Hospice.  They do not pay for meds for the co-morbidity - secondary diagnoses.   They also pay for palliative and comfort meds.  They do not cover extraordinary life-saving treatment, but we all are pretty much aware of that.
  So; my mother's dementia meds were covered by Hospice, but her Blood Pressure meds were not as that was for a co-morbidity - hypertension; her insurance covered that under Medicare Part D.
  If the patient were admitted for COPD, prescriptions relating to that diagnosis would be covered, but not for other existing conditions. 
  My step-dad admitted at one point had his dementia meds covered, but not his vascular meds as his primary diagnosis for admission was dementia.  He greatly improved and was discharged from Hospice.  His second admission to Hospice was related to his grave, end-stage vascular condition and those meds were covered along with his comfort meds, but not his dementia meds.
  While Hospice does not provide a daily, full-day aide in the house, (except that three times a week for bathing, shaving and light housekeeping of the patient areas), my mother's Hospice did indeed provide an LVN for the period of the evolving terminal event if needed - such as at night so we could sleep, but we did not require that service.  Not all Hospices may provide this.  One can ask.  Some Hospices have special services they choose to provide; we see this with some agencies providing incontinence supplies and others that do not.
  Palliative Care is a step between Home Health and Hospice.  One receives supportive care for their chronic condition likely to lead to death and declining, but the patient may still seek care at the acute hospital and to the negative, it does not include paying for equipment or meds as is done in Hospice.  It is a good between place for patients who need the care, but do who are not yet ready to sign on to Hospice. 
  Pure Palliative Care is difficult to come by.  Kaiser Permanente, (a large HMO), has an excellent Palliative Care program.  There are a small number of Hospice organizations that have pure Palliative Care in addition to their Hospice program, but that is not usual.  In such a lacking situation, Palliative Care can be provided under the Home Care umbrella and be paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other third parties (if it is a benefit of the policy) as ordered by the physician.
  NOTE:   One of our long-term very active Forum Members mother was admitted to Hospice - her mother was able to sit upright, walk with a walker, was able to eat, was ""reasonably continent,"" had one co-morbidity - hypothyroid which was, ""easily treated"" with oral medication.
  This patient and her caregiver received marvelous Hospice care and support.  The mother passed away not that long ago; pretty much mid-stride with her walker - it may well have been secondary to a stroke. 
  So . . . . . even though your husband may not fit the ""FAST"" criteria, it will serve you well to go ahead and have Hospice come out to assess him and to speak with you.  He may well fit the ""softer"" criteria for admission; but if he does not, Hospice will give you much information and an overview of their services and when to contact them again.  This is invaluable information and nothing will be lost.  And remember . . . each Hospice organization is different from the other with different ways they measure, so nothing ventured nothing gained in that set of dynamics.
  So that is the end of Goldilocks and the Three Bears . . . . oh wait . . . that's another story . . . . well; later on that one.
  With soft hugs and the very, very best wishes that can be,

The benadryl in those  'harmless' OTC sleep medications are probably the very worst choice in an older person.

We have a small farm but there are things that need to get done that I can't do and he can't/won't/shouldn't.  He let the coop scout the fields for when they needed to get sprayed.  The other day the person who has some plots on our land called to tell him that he needed to spray the beans for bugs.  My dh who tells me how he loves farming, does not go check the crops to keep an eye on things.
  We have had an increase in fixing dumb accidents.  He sees no relationship to those and him having a problem.  I know his reasoner is broken.  He thinks he is going to run the combine and haul in grain.  I can't physically help anymore.  He gets mad because I won't help but the Dr. has told me not to be doing that kind of work anymore. I suffer if I try.
  I am sure it will take some kind of crisis to put any change into place.  I don't think I can do anything else.  I have hired a college kid in the past to help some.  I am afraid to get someone because if they would get hurt because of my dh I know I would feel really bad as well as any lawsuit that could be filed.  I don't want someone hurt because my dh thinks all is right with him.

I knew he would die, and soon, but the nurse assured me he would ""sleep it off"".  I left his room at 9:30 pm and by the time I got home 30 minutes later, I got the call that he passed.  I think he waited for me to leave so he could leave as well.
My husband had the same experience with his mother, she was in bed, unconscious due to being on constant morphine medication, and she started the gargling breathing.

What I've learned with caring for my mother is you should just straight out tell her. The part of their minds that can read between the lines is usually one of the first things this disease robs from our LO.
I would just sit her down and explain she has Alzheimer's, and that means that her brain is slowly dying. She needs to take this certain medication to slow down the progression, but this is a war that she has to fight within herself.
Now I know that's pretty blunt, and you could water it down if it makes you feel more comfortable. But like I said before, at least with my mother, she can't read between the lines and she's really seemed to benefit from me just laying everything out on the table.

  For the last 2 years my mother was much like your mom is now. She had all these delusions about me, such as that I stole her house key out of her purse and I come over to steal things from her. Another delightful delusion is that I'm the reincarnation of my deceased father's old girlfriend, and so I am trying to do terrible things to her. She was living alone still and certainly didn't want any help from me. She couldn't understand why I just wouldn't leave her alone.
  Then she broke her hip. What a horrible experience for us both. After surgery, she started having hallucinations (i.e., water falling down the walls; things were falling out of the ceiling so she kept trying to hop out of bed on her broken hip). She wanted me there, but at the same time she hated me. I couldn't calm her down, and the look she gave me when I offered to help made me think she was like a feral animal! They called in the psychiatrist to get her under control.
  Sounds a lot like your mom, doesn't it?
  You've received some great advice so far. I will add a bit more. Your mother gets violent with you, which is a big problem. Always carry a charged cell phone on your person. Set up a safe room where you can go and lock yourself in. Do this right away. Then if your mom tries to hit you again, go right to your safe room and lock the door. Call 911 on your handy cell phone. Tell the operator that your mom is an Alzheimer's patient and that she is threatening to hurt you, and that you need to have your mom taken to the ER for a psych evaluation.
  Once she's at the ER, your mom may turn into Princess Perfect without a clue as to why she is there. Or she may continue to rant and rave. However she acts, do not allow them to discharge your mom to you. Tell them you are unable to keep your mom safe and that she needs to have a psych evaluation. Repeat as often as necessary until your mom gets that psych eval.
  See about getting that POA as soon as you can, before your mom is declared incompenent. You will need that POA very soon. Don't be surprised if she refuses to make you her POA. Maybe your mom will allow you to be her POA, but if not, would one of your brothers be a good alternative? My mother didn't trust me enough (due to her delusions), so my son is her POA, and that works out ok. I make all the decisions, and he signs the paperwork.

In the last five years we've moved my mom three times, most recently into memory care. It was hard each time. Moving is a lot of work, period.

Those attacks can be very painful, but there’s also big risks in anesthesia for PWDs. Although now, it seems the surgery is very minimally invasive and not like it was a few years ago. I know a couple people who had it in the last few months, said it was nothing, barely left tiny tiny scar. But they don’t have dementia.
Weighing that pain vs. Anesthesia (unless they can use something less risky now) makes for hard, hard decisions. I think I would avoid surgery unless he was having, or about to have, painful attack, but your doc may have other info for you to consider.
Just a side..this makes me think how much so many medical procedures have changed in the last 10 years or. Procedures that used to mean major surgery and days in hospital, are now done outpatient, with virtually no incision (pinhole, keyhole, sound waves etc) and out-patient basis.

I too am conflicted about making mom a Ward of the State of Hawaii. I'm afraid it's not going to go down well when the lawyer serves her. I am wondering now if I just should have applied for Guardianship of her myself rather than making the Hawaii Office of Public Guardian her legal guardian. It doesn't sound like it would be much different than if I become the guardian because they still have to figure out her finances and apply for Medicaid. In the meantime, she stays with me. And then after she gets Medicaid, the time it will take to get her an open, appropriate place.
She's calm now. So, I feel kind of badly. But, I really don't feel I can be her Guardian. She doesn't want to go to a home. Even if I do become her guardian, my attorney friend told me that I'd probably have to call the police to get her to a care home. I thought I would get away from all this ugly situation if the Office of Public Guardian did all this. Now, I'm not so sure.
We can no longer stay in the free apartment (we were in a fire) because mom caused problems. So we gotta pay rent now in the new place.

We are doing well right now. I moved us to a new house in May, 2015. We were out in the country.  I just decided that I couldn't do dementia care out in the middle of nowhere. The roads were unpaved and got almost impassable in the winter. And then there was shoveling. And mowing the property in the summer. And maintaining the house - all without help from hubby. He was the backbone. He worked so hard out there and now he can't. 
I bought an older home - built in 1965. It is in the city, a mere 10 minutes from our church and, also important, the doctor. We used to be 45 minutes away, and I had to do all the driving. It was exhausting. 
The house is bigger than the old one. It has laminate flooring throughout, with tile in the kitchen, laundry room, and bathrooms. It is all one level. The master bath is mostly disability accessible. I had ramps installed in the doorways to reduce the risk of falls. 
My son and I got the automatic sprinkler system working so the grass and plants are growing well. We never really had a lawn at the old house because we didn't have automatic sprinklers. 
The first six months we were here, hubby was kind of like a robot. Then, earlier this year, we weaned him off of the antipsychotic that he was on. Bingo! His personality started to come back. Then, early in June, he was switched from Namenda XR 28mg to generic memantine 10mg twice a day. I can't even believe the change. He's happier and more talkative. He is even joking around and actually laughing again. He hasn't really laughed in a couple of years. But, just so I don't start to think he's ""cured"" or something, I realize that he can't follow simple directions or even count. And his memory is still very poor. I hope his good humor lasts.
I have also decided to start guardianship proceedings for our son. He is 24 and has autism. He can do a lot of things for himself, but not enough. I'm already doing a lot for him. I just want the legal authority to do this without having to get his verbal permission all the time. ",0,1

4007.14,"From https://www.dementiacarecentral.com/aboutdementia/treating/memantine/
Memantine, commonly prescribed under the brand name Namenda® in the United States, is the first of a new class of drugs designed to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. Other Alzheimer’s drugs — such as Aricept® — work by improving communication between brain cells. Memantine works differently, preventing the damage and destruction of brain cells that occurs due to increased levels of a chemical in the brain called glutamate.
Memantine helps keep cells from being overstimulated or getting “burned out” from too much glutamate. As a result, individuals who take memantine may have improved memory and ability as compared to those who don’t take the medication. Memantine is more commonly prescribed to individuals in middle to late stages of dementia since it can often help individuals for whom cholinesterase inhibitors have stopped working. Furthermore, as the drugs affect the brain in different ways, individuals may use both cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine at the same time, if a doctor recommends it.
It is important to remember that memantine and other Alzheimer’s drugs do not stop or reverse dementia’s progression, but they can help slow the disease. In general, individuals who use memantine experience few side effects. The most commonly experienced side effects include dizziness, headaches, and constipation. Memantine may not be suitable for individuals with kidney or liver disease or a seizure disorder.",0,1

  Only ONE nuero mentioned NPH to us...we saw several...they ruled out some other dementias or medical problems....but, based on Mom's symptoms alone, NPH should have been considered, as the one neuro did...she didn't have it, she had a UTI! But some of the symptoms seemed like she had it - she had bad balance, etc...
  HuffPo tends to kind of run ''old'' stories, but some have helped me.  I think this HuffPo article is written by a blogger, who has also written this book
  http://www.amazon.com/Come-Back-Early-Today-Alzheimers/dp/0983570612%3FSubscriptionId%3D0JJEH4PKQM4ZHS8QY102%26tag%3Dthehuffingtop-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0983570612 
  Larry, I am sorry that you feel ''down'' - you have done so much, I can't imagine being able to do much more.  I always welcome any stories and articles that put real info out there about dementia..
  There is help for NPH out there - even that help, though, doesn't always ''cure'' NPH...and with others, a correct diagnosis, a med, a therapy, or an idea, won't cure AD right now...it's like the devastating cancers that take peoples' lives...
  My experience with this neuro, and others, showed me how limited some doctors could be, at least around here...
  When we do a lot, sometimes we think we can do more.  we just can't - we're human, with human limitations...

28973.63,"I am so sorry you are still struggling with this decision, but I can completely see why.  I have a cut to the chase question: How many life extending measures does your mom want?  Would you give her a feeding tube or artificial hydration?  I ask because if no, and she is stage 7, does it seem reasonable that she might not have many years of life left?  If she had one aspiration pneumonia, are chances that she will have another, and does each one get harder to recover from? 
  I ask all of this because of my own experiences:  These past years I have made many, many sacrifices to take care of my FIL.  I have put on hold developing my career plans.  My life has revolved around him. I asked myself often if I was sacrificing too much, doing the right thing, knowing that it could go on for a long, long time and I deserved to have a life while keeping him comfortable.  As you know, he died a few days ago.  I feel so wonderful that I spent the time I spent making him comfortable. So what, I put my life in hold for a few year.  It is a blink in the length of my life time.  I am soo, so glad that I have zero regrets about my choices.
  There were many times that I considered moving him into my home.  People always said to me - then you will be making your home into a hospital.  So what?  That might not be the worst thing in the world and it will not last forever, especially if she is stage 7. 
  Also, you said: ""She sits up in a wheelchair all day in a noisy hallway, scared and confused.""  And that she is agitated.  But you said she gets great medical care.  I don't think that is great medical care.  Psychological health is a part of medical health.  Her situation does not sound healthy to me. 
   Is the dichotomy you are presenting really the only way it can look?  What is keeping you from giving her good physical health in your home?  It already sounds like the mental health in the nursing home stinks. 
  For me, it is not so much about home or an institution.  Some institutions are acceptable and  make more sense than being at home.  The question is quality of life for the amount of time she has left.  Stage 7 is no picnic, even if there are windows of joy and comfort throughout the day.  I would do whatever gives her quality and mental and physical comfort, even if it means it will not necessarily keep her alive as long. 
    If it were me, give me comfort, love, and caring in whatever environment can provide it.

Yes, I have many days that I'm just fed up with what my life has become.  My husband ignored doctors, his sister and me for years and would not follow a proper diet.  He's diabetic.  I asked him thousands of times to take his medications, eat properly, go to the doctor and he actually said ""I am not changing my lifestyle"".  Honestly?  I'm so angry with him now !!
2 1/2 years ago my mother had a 4th stroke and I brought her to live with us (I also have two boys) thinking it would be great having Mom here; shopping, lunches, working in the garden, quilting together . . .except, I quickly learned Mom no longer had the focus or attention span to do things with me.  She can't even focus to read a book or watch television and it's grown worse this past couple of years.
Three months after Mom moved in, my husband became seriously ill.  He had a diabetic ulcer on his right foot that he'd tried to hide . . he developed Sepsis infection in his blood stream.  Then I had the issue . . who takes care of Mom while my husband is in the hospital and I have to be there.  I scrambled with neighbors, friends, my sisters and friends from church who pitched in, but it was hard because Mom didn't know them and didn't feel comfortable.  The day after my husband was admitted to the hospital, he developed a blood clot in his left leg.  I had to sign papers giving permission for his leg to be amputated.
He spent weeks in the hospital on kidney dialysis, then in rehab learning how to manuver . . several months later the left leg became infected again and had to be amputated as well.
If feels like overnight I've become caregiver to both my mother and my husband.  Every day is the same - I go from one to the other making sure they have what they need.  I scramble handling absolutely everything because my husband (who never admitted he should have taken care of himself) is perfectly content watching television 24/7.  Depression?  Not really.  He seems to take things in stride with no regard the burden he has piled on me.
And yes, I feel selfish when I'm angry.  I hate that they both frustrate me . . I hate when my mother has hallucinations and calls me in the middle of the night to say ""there's a lady screaming"" or they are people in costumes in the bathroom or there's a fire in the hallway.
My friends all seem to have moved on, my sisters are enjoying   their lives and  seldom call or visit, but I was able to sign Mom up with a Corporation of Aging and qualified for part-time in home Aid service five mornings a week.  It's not perfect, but I am getting help and five mornings a week I leave this house, drive to a park along the river and go for a brisk walk. 
Find something to relieve the stress !!  I walk, I sew and I have an ebay store that makes me feel like I have something just for me.
And do search - there might be an organization in your area that offers a service like in-home Aid so you have some time for yourself aside from the day care.  See, daycare wouldn't take my mother - she won't participate at all and she's afraid out of her own surroundings.
But there are places out there.

Farmer Joe was in his car when he was hit by a truck. He decided his injuries from the accident were serious enough to take the trucking company (responsible for the accident) to court. In court the trucking company's fancy lawyer was questioning farmer Joe. ""Didn't you say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine'?"" said the lawyer.
Farmer Joe responded, ""Well I'll tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite mule Bessie into the...."" ""I didn't ask for any details,"" the lawyer interrupted, ""just answer the question.""
""Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine'!""
Farmer Joe said, ""Well I had just got Bessie into the trailer and I was driving down the road....""
The lawyer interrupted again and said, ""Judge, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the Highway Patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question.""
By this time the Judge was fairly interested in Farmer Joe's answer and said to the lawyer, ""I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule Bessie.""
Joe thanked the Judge and proceeded, ""Well as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other.
I was hurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear ole Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.
Shortly after the accident a Highway Patrolman came on the scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes.
Then the Patrolman came across the road with his gun in his hand and looked at me. He said, ""Your mule was in such bad shape I had to shoot her. How are you feeling?""

37960.2,"Dear Becky,
What you are experiencing is a very natural and normal caregiver reaction.  All I can say that the best thing that you can do is to read, read and read some more about this disease; become informed and knowledgeable. Find a local caregiver group to attend so that you will not feel alone or isolated.  Or share regularly on this forum.   It has very little to do with YOU in regards with  the mean and ugly things that he is saying.  Their brains are not working or functioning in a normal manner.  He may not even remember what he is SORRY for.
I cannot tell you HOW ANGRY I WAS WITH MY SPOUSE OF 40+ YEARS once I finally realized and acknowledged what was going on.  I was so pissed (excuse the language please)- I worked with Srs. in a Hospital setting, and had been trying for years to get him to be more mentally active.  He simply refused to believe that I knew ANYTHING about ANYTHING.
It took me a couple of years, and with the progression of the disease I was able to come to grips with what was happening.  First and foremost I decided that I would treat him like a PERSON WITH A  MIND DEBILITATING DISEASE and not as the husband who I had been living with (49 years now) --a different---- and sometime very difficult---- person  who was currently living in the same house.   After all, HE WAS AND IS  NOT THE SAME MAN.  That somewhat small (or huge) deception told to me--by me-- made all the difference in my world  of being able to cope. (I also told myself, ""treat him like you would like to taken care of if this happened to you!) ;some days I failed  but most days I made it work. 
  I hope you will find something that will help you to balance out what is happening to you.  This is an extraodinarily HARD journey and job that we are faced with.

47107.8,"Hello Katrinka:  I think your statement was related to the fact that your dear husband has a diagnosed dementia and not a diagnosed mental illness and you are concerned because he is being prescribed medication for mental illness when he has not been diagnosed with one.
  The simplest answer to your concern, is that dementia affects the brain and causes all sorts of dysfunction including for some patients, significant behavioral issues  . . . .
  Mental illness affects the processes within the brain.  Medication has been developed to assist with helping this including relieving significant behavioral issues . . . .
  Medications, especially the antipsychotics can be helpful with behavioral issues for more than just one type of diagnosis . . . .
  So . . . when there are significant behavioral issues in a dementia patient and all lesser intervention measures have failed to be of assistance, very often, the only meds that bring relief will be the antipsychotic medications.
  It does not matter for what the drug was originally developed, if it is effective for other purposes in some patients, then it is entirely appropriate to prescribe that medication.
  NOTE:  If our Loved One is over the moon, uncontrollable in behaviors, etc., and if they are driving us to distraction; imagine how dreadful it must be for them to live inside their heads with such awful feelings, believing all the delusions and hallucinations and feeling all the anger and rage; it is a hellish existence which compromises their very quality of life.
  In such a situation, if there is a medication that can help, it would be unconscionable not to permit that assistance and bring the poor person a decent quality of life.
  That is why for some patients, such medications are prescribed by GeroPsyciatrists, Neurologists, Geriatricians and primary MDs.

It will be nice for you to get the fencing done so the cattle and bulls can stay where you want them.

I did set up my computer. It had prompts to follow, so wasn't hard.

Glad to hear Sarah is doing somewhat better. I hope she is on the right track with the doctors and can find the help she needs.

Leanne, I'm surprised we haven't had a freeze yet too. Usually it freezes in September and turns warm again. You're keeping Dale on his toes. That's a good thing. Not bad to be independent.

Sandra, happy you are at least getting calls for day care. I hope it gets settled this week so you can plan a few things for yourself. Good news.

Twink, you are going to need a vacation after all the work you've been doing. I am going to get the cob webs down and do some deep cleaning before Thanksgiving when all the family will be together.

I better get off here and get the rest of the kid's dinner going. Parent teacher conferences tonight.

Have a restful night. I'm thinking of jfock and her family tonight. I hope she can rest. Joan",1,1

28413.7,"About 18 months ago, I found that I was ""snippy"" with my Mom. Like you, I knew it was the wrong way to handle her, and felt bad about it.    My decision was to insist (and it was not easy, lots of tears) that she attend the local Adult Day Care program. She started by going 3 days a week.   The Day Care also had Saturday program - so she went 2 weekdays and Saturday.   That gave my husband and I our time to go to things and not take her along, or worry about having her home alone. 
The other advantage of Day Care is that she was tired at night and would go to bed at 8pm -- so we would have the evening to ourselves.   
If you don't want to use Day Care, maybe a home health aide could come in just to be her new friend and talk to her. 
As far as conversation, it has been years since I tried to talk to my Mom about anything other then what her current obsession was.   
Also, I keep reminding myself that my mom has short-term memory loss.  That may sound dumb -- but for example, you go out and not take your mom along.  You feel guilty the next day, and she has forgotten all about it.  Or gone back to obsessing over where her favorite lamp went to. 
I hope this is more helpful than my other post, I had just kept my Mom home on Tuesday for Doctor appts, she had just gone to bed, and my mind was boggled.

46118.27,"I took the keys away 15 months ago.  It had to be done!  I didn't want to have to live with my husband hurting himself, or someone else.  Perhaps a child, or a young family. 
  He is still furious with me about not being able to drive, and life in general.  He complains that this all started because of the doctor that I brought him to 3.5 years ago.  The doctor was kind and spent a great deal of time with him, but the diagnosis (after very thorough testing including a neuro psychologist) was EOAD.   The first couple of years the decline seemed to be slower.  But by the third year, the decline seems to have increased and he is now at stage 5-6.  We had to change doctors because he refused to go back to see the first one.  The new doctor is a woman and he likes her enough to at least attend appointments without excessive complaining.   I didn't expect to be a caregiver at this point in life.  I'm sure none of us did.  This disease is brutal, and I know it will only get worse.
  Two months ago, his anxiety and aggressiveness escalated.  That is being controlled somewhat better with meds.  Everyday is a challenge, and I never know what the next problem will be. There has been a major decline in communication skills.  He can't find the words that he wants to speak.   And, he gets frustrated when I can't figure out what he is trying to tell me.

That said, is it really the case that he is not interested in the activities, or is he making up excuses as to why he doesn't want to do them? I could see my mom saying that ""their activities don't interest me"" when the real problem is that she is losing her ability to participate in those activities.

24380.5,"If you have any indication they will need Medicaid at all, I would limit my facility search to places that accept Medicaid only, because you can still start private pay at them and then they may only have to change rooms once they are on Medicaid.

It would be really unfortunate to choose a NH and when the money runs out you have to search again for a facility.

Hopefully you already have 5 years' worth of financial records for them together, if you don't it's a good idea to get that together.  Get together all assets like stocks, bonds, life insurance, etc. so you have an idea what assets they truly do have.

The ideal situation is a planned move, not a crisis, so about 1 year prior to the money running out, I'd get them on waiting lists at the facility(ies) of choice and figure anywhere from 3 months to 6 months for a bed to open up.  If you want 2 beds in the same room, you will have to discuss your planning with the administrator - 2 beds open at the same time sometimes is problematic and you would want to get the facilities input on when you should plan to move them.

They could be admitted as private pay and the Medicaid application can be submitted at that time also and when they are below the asset threshold for Medicaid, you will already have approval and the payor just becomes Medicaid and whatever their share is out of their Social Security.",0,1

There were a million times that something had to be addressed and I felt like I was completely lost. I can't tell you how many times I just said (mostly to myself) ""I don't know what to do"".

I think it's ok for her to pace safely in the home.  We did eventually have to install keyed deadbolts on our two outside doors, so we could lock them when we went to bed at night, and she would not wander out.  We left the keys on the top of the door sill, so whoever was home could always unlock the door & get people out in an emergency, but she would not notice the key there.  We would often drive her to her old neighborhood & talk about the places around where she grew up.  We could park by the curb & she would happily talk and talk.  In nice weather, we would go for a walk every day when I came home from work- this sometimes had the added benefit of giving her fresh air & tiring her enough to have a nice quiet rest.  We would also drive her to my sister's house that was nearby- but as time progressed, she also could not stay there for very long.

20871.2,"UTI's are notorius for sending a person with dementia into a tailspin.  Always when you notice any sudden changes in behavior and confusion, check for a UTI, it is often the culprit for the changes you may see.
  Actually any illness or infection can have this affect on a person, especially with dementia.  Often they have the infection going for awhile before anyone can know what's going on and it's usually the behavioral changes that clue us in.  I sure didn't know about this until my mom experienced it and reading other posters having the same experience.
  Often when the medication kicks in and the infection starts going away, you'll will see them come back to where they were before the infection.  Keep an eye out and if you don't see improvement check with her doctor for another culture to make sure the infection hasn't come back.
  There are silent UTI's, the person may not know they have, they may not feel it, and we may not notice their urine is darker.  I didn't know this either.  I've had UTI's and they have been very painful and get worse quick, so I was stumped when my mom didn't complain of pain and I was surprised when her doctor said she had a UTI.

jfkoc's suggestion of a handicapped restroom is very helpful. My mom has a two-story house and I tried suggesting for years to extend the half bathroom, located on the first floor, and to add a bedroom to the ground floor. She never wanted to do either and I lived an ocean away so couldn't advocate any stronger. After her big fall that landed her in the hospital and then rehab, we were able to bring her home but I ordered a hospital bed for the living room. I also had a paid caregiver come in the mornings to help give my mom a sponge bath in the bathroom since there was no shower in there. It all worked ok but would've been much easier had renovations been made long before there was a critical need.
I had financial power-of-attorney but she was reluctant to give me healthcare power-of-attorney because she wanted to remain independent. I finally asked her doctor to write a letter, which he had no problem doing, and that kicked my healthcare power-of-attorney into play. By that point, though, she didn't care if I was in the room with the doctors. Creating online access helps a lot to keep an eye on finances. One challenge is that if you show the POA to the VA (if that's relevant to you) or Social Security, you will have to create a separate fiduciary account. I went through that with the VA and it was awfully stressful. I regret having applied for the $300/month Aid and Attendance money from the VA because it wasn't worth the stress I went through in getting appointed her fiduciary.",0,1

37109.14,"I likely have done this somewhere before on one of these threads but I will do it again.
peroxynitrite formation in cerebral blood vessels is needed for the cerebrovascular effects of Abeta...These effects of Abeta were abolished by ROS scavengers (tempol, MnTBAP), NADPH oxidase inhibition (gp91ds-tat), NOS inhibition (L-NNA) and by the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst FeTPPS or PARP inhibition (PJ34; Fig. 4c–e). Thus, Abeta leads to endothelial DNA damage and PARP activation via oxidative–nitrosative stress.
Furthermore, conditioned media derived from CT105 (c-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein)-treated astrocytes enhanced neurotoxicity and pretreatment with NO and peroxynitrite scavengers attenuated its toxicity. 
A natural scavenger of peroxynitrites, rosmarinic acid, protects against impairment of memory induced by Abeta(25-35).
Malinow’s team found that when mice are missing the PKC alpha gene, neurons functioned normally, even when amyloid beta was present. Then, when they restored PKC alpha, amyloid beta once again impaired neuronal function. In other words, amyloid beta doesn’t inhibit brain function unless PKC alpha is active [PKC is part of the early pathway that leads to oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease].

Without oxidative stress there is no amyloid, amyloid without oxidative stress there is no Alzheimer's disease, no amyloid with oxidative stress there can still be Alzheimer's disease.  
The evidence that nitro-oxidative stress is cause of Alzheimer's disease is overwhelming: every factor that increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease increases that stress, every factors that reduces that stress reduces the risk for Alzheimer's disease, every aspect of the disease can be explained by oxidation, nitration, and DNA damage, every compound that has lead to improvements in the disease has been a peroxynitrite scavenger.  
I have spent thirteen years putting the pathways and causes of this disease together piece by piece.  It is not arrogance but confidence in the evidence that makes me feel the distance to the finish line is not much further.",0,1

25762.3,"Hello Shelley:   I can well understand the stress and dreadful concern this is causing you; however, I don't  think you have anything to be too worried about.  I too faced a similar dynamic.
  My mother's dementia was over the top and she was delusion driven.  My poor step-dad who was very elderly, could not keep her reigned in.  I had DPOA for Healthcare and was also the DPOA for Finance.   I also was the one conducting all financial dynamics for the parents and paid all their bills.
  Mom kept trying to plunder the bank accounts, and despite her dementia, could make calls to the bank and and order blank checks, etc.
  Step-dad, my step-brother and I finally went to the bank.  We closed the accounts and re-opened them under a different number.  I was also the person who paid all the bills for the parents and conducted all business. 
  One day, my mother had a care aide take her to the bank where she went to the manager and complained that I had stolen money from her and was taking her funds without her permission and was keeping her from her money and was spending it on trips and jewelry (laughable), etc.
  By the way; the bank already had a photocopy of the DPOAs on file.  The bank manager contacted me and explained that she did not think I was doing anything wrong as the accounts were intact and all checked out alright, BUT she was bound by law and policy to notify the Police Department and Adult Protective Services.
  E-E-E-E-E-E-K!!!!!!
  I was initially shocked to the core; then I was plunged into deep concern - ""what if?""  Though I knew all was alright, I was unsure about what this all meant.
  Well . . . . . the police and APS evidently checked out the accounts, found there were no withdrawals, and all checks written on the accounts were for valid expenses - medical, utilities, prescriptions, etc.  We never heard one single word yay or nay. 
  Nothing happened and I was also very pleased that I kept all billings with dates paid, kept all cancelled checks and did monthly Financial Accounting Reports with balances for all accounts and a listing of all checks written:  the amount, to whom and what for.
  Each bill had a separate file and I filed each one and I kept them separated by year in a permanent file storage box.  If anyone ever questioned me, I could immediatly put my finger on the questioned file and display the history with no difficulty.
  So - I do not think you have anything to be concerned about; but if it were me, I would probably make an appointment with the bank manager and explain I understood his/her duty in reporting anything that may appear untoward and I appreciate the protection this means for my mother, but I want to know if everything is now alright and if we can proceed.
  If it makes one feel any better, one can also contact the officer who came out to interview the family and ask for the outcome of the interview.
  If anything comes back to you as uncertain, then you can contact an attorney, but I think the manager was just doing his/her job and that all is well considering the paperwork is in order and your mother was able to interact without difficulty regarding her wishes.
  Do let us know how this turns out, we will be thinking of you.  With my best wishes,

12290.5,"I'm concerned that her excuse of going out for a Coke may be just an excuse. It sounds like wandering to me.
Your mom's mental stability comes and goes at this point. I don't think you can wait for her to be completely into her dementia before you take action. I know it must have been startling for your to hear that news from your doctor, especially since you weren't expecting it. Why he didn't call you, first, we'll never know...
During her lucid moments, expect your mother to accuse you of ""dumping"" her. My mother-in-law CHOSE the assisted living facility she lived in. She said she didn't want to live with use like her mother-in-law did. She was very, very clear about this. But several months later, when she was all moved in to the AL facility, I still recall the day she said we ""dumped"" her there. That really hurt. But that's the reality we deal with when our loved ones have dementia. No matter how lovingly we do things for them, their disease will cause them to forget the choices they made and blame us even though we followed their wishes.
I would be careful trying to do that nursing student thing. You'd want your mom to have a companion who was going to be constant, not a student who leaves after graduation.
You should look into memory care now. Many of the facilities near where I live have long waiting lists. My mother-in-law was in AL for a couple of years before we realized we should have put her in memory care. I think the AL facility tried to keep her there as long as they could because that was $$$ in their coffers. But then it got to the point where she was  wandering into other residents' rooms and wouldn't leave. Then, we got a call because she showed up at the front door of the AL facility at 1am saying she was waiting for us to pick her up. The second time, the maintenance worker saw her sitting on the outdoor porch at 4am where she said she was waiting for the pizza delivery guy. I called her doctor who examined her and said she needed to be in a secure, memory care facility.
Believe me, I know it ""sucks"" to have to take this next step. I don't like using the word, ""sucks,"" but it pretty much sums up the situation in one word.

If you or your loved one are over 50, get the vaccine, which does not prevent 100% but does make it less likely to have a bad case, or to develop the PHN afterwards.

15687.2,"Hello! Reminding and correcting her will get you nowhere, as you've already experienced. The best way to deal with this behavior is to simply apologize, even if you didn't do anything wrong. You're not going to convince her that you told her all the things she says you didn't. By telling her you did, you're most likely scaring her and frustrating her, because in her reality, what you're saying happened, didn't. If someone kept telling you that you had forgotten something as important as a baby's birth, yet you didn't remember it, it would be very frightening, and your first instinct would be to fight back.

If she accuses you of not telling her something, stealing her stuff, etc. (very common), simply apologize and say you won't let it happen again. That was the only way I could appease my mom. She would insist she hadn't been told something (like your mom), or she'd say that I took something of hers when I most certainly hadn't. Fighting with her was useless, and all it did was upset both of us even more. When I learned to just say I was sorry and then switch the direction of the conversation, the problem passed. If I tried to insist on MY reality, she would get angry and tearful.

This carried through to moving my mom to memory care when the time came. She'd ask to go home (her childhood home), and I would tell her it was a great idea and I'd check to see when I could get off work. Telling her, ""You're 85 years old and your childhood home is no longer even there"" would be heartless and futile.

On several visits she has reminded me that family takes care of each other and that I should take her home and hire someone to help her. She tells others that I dumped her there and do not visit. I have taken to the attitude that if it is stressful to her I will leave. The staff tells me that her best days are those that I do not visit as she gets involved in the activities and helping the staff and residents.

The impact of moves on people with dementia is emphasized by many, but the vast majority of people are surprised at a fairly easy adjustment.  If you are oozing anxiety about this, she will too.
No discussion until the day of the move - ""Mom, I've heard the help is better here and I Know the food is.  You deserve this!""      or ""This is a much better value, my friend loves it here!"" or whatever is going to appeal to your Mom's CURRENT BUZZ POINTS.
I had to move my LO 4 times within 6 weeks once - it was not traumatic and he did best when he arrived t the structure of MC.
The lovely apartment no longer has meaning any more than the old lovely house she left.  It is not a safe setting.  It does not provide the care she needs.  She's not bathing, not eating because there is no aide to accompany her to the dining room and she is wandering.

20359.11,"Hopping back on to add a few additional thoughts....
I agree that telling an AD LO that their beloved pet was killed in an accident is not generally the best way to go.  That really was only specific to my father-in-law, who hated the dog but couldn't figure out how to let it go.  I guess this would be where the disclaimer ""Don't try this at home"" would be inserted.
My own Mom has her beloved doggie (truly, she loves the dog more than me!) with her in her 1bdrm apt. in her ""independent living"" situation.  It was a screaming indication of how far along Mom was in the downward spiral of Alz. when her dog lost 10 lbs in one year (from 26 to 16 lbs).  She was not feeding the poor thing, but declared strongly and frequently that she fed the dog every morning and night.  (and her amazing daughter was obviously not paying any attention to the dog and didn't notice the weight loss). 
I solved the problem by getting a gravity feeder so the dog can eat at will.  He's put his weight back on.  And the Vet wrote a note that I taped to the feeder that Mom is not to touch it or add water or....
My own 14 yr. old Brittany Spaniel is failing and I know that we won't be getting a new puppy, as I anticipate taking over Mom's dog sometime in the next year when she no longer can manage to remember to take him out. Or when she moves to Asst. Living...

My girlfriend noticed and commented that it was nice to see me more like my ""old self."" I don't always feel that way but I do know that for the first time in what feels like forever I can breathe.
My husband and I had hoped for a break but it wasn't meant to be. His father is in later stages of dementia living in assisted living with his mother. She had a stroke one week ago and is unable to return to their facility. That puts his father in a position of not being able to stay there either. They will both need to be in a skilled nursing facility with memory care. My husband is POA so the responsibility falls to him to find a new home for them. He is blessed to have 2 sisters that are right there in the trenches with him so that lightens his load a little.
My father also has dementia and is living in an assisted living facility but will need to transition into memory care soon. I'm hoping his path will be smoother than Mom's. But whatever comes, I know I can handle it.
Take a walk. Get a pedicure. Have lunch with friends. It's baby steps. Don't beat yourself up if it's a bad day. Just treat it as a bad day and then do your best tomorrow. And know that you are not alone!

     When my husband was in early stages I also wondered if it was to stay nice in calm in the boat,  and I hoped that it would.    I'm sure there are a lot that do have a ""whole road ""  of calm and nice.   So that can be done.   However,  on the whole my husband is still nice, and calm,  he has some flair up's...  His whole like he was easy going, willing to go along, never getting upset.   But when we reached stage 6 and he was losing more and more freedom.  You could see the frustration on his face because he knew he could not do certain things he use to do.   So that frustration came out on me.   He did tell me he was going to ""bash my head in"".  He has  ""held both my wrist long and hard"" where I could not release them, and my son had to help.    But for the most part Rich is Rich,  ""just happy that you are doing for him"".   But I have to say  his ""medical Day care helps"".  because he spends time away from US.... so that gives us all a brake,  and we don't feel smothered.    I think we would see more angry if he was here every day 24/7.    So as long as they can be active,  keep them active.   When they cannot any longer be active,  it doesn't matter than.  they just want to be comfortable.   My Daughter is a Nurse and has taken Care of many Alz patients.  She says too, the anger i'm seeing is from him,  Losing more and more of himself.   Pretty soon he will not notice what he is losing, he will be too far into it.   Good Luck my Friend.

11685.3,"Your mother might be in stage 7 if she is non-ambulatory and 100% incontenent.  Look at this document to determine what stage she is in:
https://www.alzinfo.org/understand-alzheimers/clinical-stages-of-alzheimers/
I would treat the C-diff and UTI's and see how things go before making other decisions.  I don't think there is a right or wrong decision for your mother at this point since we don't know for sure if someone will come up with a treatment path that will eradicate the C-diff and UTI.  
Meanwhile do research on hospices in your area.  They all have different philosophies.  For us, I was only interested in those that neither hasten nor slow death.  Unfortunately some hospices function more like a machine where they intake the patient to their facility and within about 3 days the patient is deceased.  So be wary and do ask doctors and nurses which hospices they recommend. Find one that lines up with your own beliefs.
To me the most important way to determine if your mother's life is ending is if she can no longer swallow and no longer wants to eat.  These two symptoms, taken in combination with loss the ability to say many words and  walk and contractures in the arms, indicate the very end of end-stage.  If the treatment of C-diff fails, then your mother will likely go in to Kidney failure as the disease spreads there (which I think it the most likely place since this seems related to a UTI as well.)  
Here is another document that will help you as well.  I found it invaluable when my mother was dying:
http://www.legacy-hospice.com/media/Patients%20&%20Families/HardChoices%20for%20Loving%20People.pdf
Please read the above and share it with family and friends who may be unfamiliar with this information.  It will answer many difficult questions in advance and help you through the end of this process with the information you need to make end of life informed decisions.
My own mother died of pneumonia complicated by sepsis which led to kidney failure.  She, too had bladder and kidney infections.  At that point, she was unable to eat or drink.  In a last ditch effort to save her life we attempted to insert a feeding tube, but the sepsis overwhelmed her body and she was admitted via the ER to ICU where she went into complete kidney failure and died 5 days later - 15 minutes after stopping the treatment that was keeping her heart pumping.  She died peacefully and was unconscious and without knowing what was happening to her.  May things be so gentle for your dear mother.
Then the weird stuff came.  As I was leaving mom's room in the ICU for the last time, the nurse put me on the phone with the mortuary where mom's body was to go and they asked me to give permission to embalm my mother.  Nobody and no document had forewarned me of such a call so it caught be off guard but even so,   I did give permission but the sense of unreality I felt at the moment...well it just all seemed so strange and shocking.

7053.5,"Hi Radar. Yes, you are at a crossroads. It does not sound as though it is safe to leave your mother alone overnight. You mention that the gerontologist you consulted works for the organization coordinating your mother's care--does that mean he works for the organization providing the in-home aides? If so, in my option, there may a self-serving motivation at work with the goal of continuing to funnel your mother's money into the organization. 24 hour care is possible at home, but it is expensive and requires a lot of supervision. A big disadvantage of home care is the potential for isolation. In MC, there are a lot of opportunities for engagement.
It sounds as though your mother is the ideal candidate for MC: physically robust but cognitively impaired, with few underlying health problems. Keep in mind longevity when you look at facilities: what are her assets, how long can she afford the cost, what happens when the money runs out, what happens when she becomes physically compromised. 
In terms of getting her there, once you have chosen a facility, it needn't be an argument or ugly confrontation. Use the strategy of fiblets: her house needs a new roof, or plumbing, or painting and the stay in the 'spa' is temporary. Repeat with variations as often as needed.",0,1

  When this first started, I would get his PCP to write orders for PT, and that would help.

Typically the Therapist comes twice a week, and you have to do the exercises twice a day in between.  Once we reached the point that he would not work with me on the exercises, I had to admit that this was a losing battle.
  I also had Dad attending the local Y for about 11 months where he did weight exercises, upper body, lower body, then 20 minutes cardio on the bike.  The lower body weight exercises kept him legs strong for that time period.  So there are things you can do to keep them moving, for a time.
  Yes, with the progression of the disease the ability to walk is lost.  I think there are 2 reasons.  1.  The person does not self initiate, so they sit a LOT and the muscles weaken.  2.  The memory of how to walk is lost.
  Dad progressed through all the typical stages: walking with a cane.  Needing a walker when tired.  Walking with a walker all the time.  Needing a wheelchair when tired -- that is where we are at currently.  He can walk about 125 feet with his walker, then he HAS to sit down, even if it means sinking to the floor.

If prior knowledge of incompetence can be found, they can sue. Auto insurance will indicate you knew but did not tell them of the medical diagnosis, and you could be in the liability soup.""

So here are a few facts you need to know:

1.  Your mother's car insurance may not be valid because she has been diagnosed with Alzheimers.
2.  In some states, if there has been a diagnosis and family members allow the person to drive they can be liable if there is a car accident that results in a death.
3.  It is the responsibility of the Alzheimer's patient's medical and financial POA to stop the driving.
4.  In some states, doctors are required to report the diagnosis to the DMV or they can also be held liable.
5.  This is NOT about your mother's confidence/independence.  This about her SAFETY and that of everyone else.  Your mother could get confused, drive off and wind up in another state.  She will eventually forget how to use her cellphone.  This often happens before the patient forgets how to drive.  Do you and your family really want to chance having to have police issue a ""Silver alert?""  


It is past time to stop your mother from driving.  The best way to do this is Operation Car-Be-Gone in which you secretly disable her car or secretly remove it, claim it is in the shop to be repaired and that a part has been ordered from overseas.  A part that will never come.

I am always stressed out on the way to the long distance appointments, but I am forced to get a handle on my feelings. To allow myself to express frustration over traffic, running late, or other issues, would serve no purpose and would cause anxiety for my mom.  After the appointments, I always take Mom to the hospital coffee shop for a mocha and a pastry. We sit either in the lobby, or on sunny days like today, we sit outside, as we wait for the valet parking attendant to bring back the car. Sometimes I play music for her on my phone while we wait. 
I remember on one occasion, we were listening to music on you tube, and some had accompanying videos. We giggled and sang along to a video of Nancy Sinatra singing These Boots are Made for Walking, and as we watched the flow of cars and people in the street outside, we listened and sang along to Petula Clark's ""Downtown"". Nobody around us seemed to notice (of course, we were in downtown Portland, home of the Uni-Piper and other assorted points of unique oddity) and we were having fun.

Yes, meds are IMPORTANT and sometimes VERY essential but I don't believe it should be the first line of defense... since there is no cure, there are also alternatives. There are many other more human simpler methods of 'working through' some of the symptoms of this neurodegenerative disease... going right away to the medicine cabinet might work for some but not for others... It all depends on the SEVERITY of the symptoms.
Naomi Feil's Validation Techniques were successful for us in easing some of the behavioural distress of dementia.
Best Practices was also beneficial.
 Yes, meds, but HOW MUCH/ HOW MANY/HOW LONG/HOW OFTEN either for them or for us???... We have to be careful with side effects... sometimes we don't even know whether it is a side-effect of the med or the disease!
I remember for us, sometimes a simple quiet walk in the fresh air in a park or by the ocean did wonders... and it cost us nothing.

I have thought long and hard about what I would do if this happened to my mother and I am thankful you took the time to write about the situation and share your thoughts. I had always thought I would do whatever it takes to keep mother comfortable and healthy-but not necessarily keep her alive-if that makes sense. So yes to pain meds and antibiotics-even IV's, but no to surgeries or invasive procedures. But it is hard to to know if that time has come and to actually deny treatments when a doctor suggest it. For that reason-I have been steeling myself for years already-and have made the decision to allow my mother to die when it appears to be her time and not try to prolong her life at all cost.

29165.3,"surgennrse I'm sorry you are having such a time getting family involved. Sadly a lot of family take the bury their head in the sand approach, if they don't call or don't see it, they hope to just drop off the radar and don't have to deal with a difficult situation. As you read through these caregiver boards, you will see this is a recurring issue, so many of us have problems getting family involved. My mom has 2 sisters and 2 brothers still alive and they know what is going on with her. Only 1 of her sisters asks how she is, her other sister acted so put out when my niece talked about bringing my mom to live close by and care for her. You'd think it was like my mom got the plague instead of AD the way people just stop talking to her. 
The truth is as people said in other threads, it's hard for them to understand and deal with, and to have to put in extra effort just makes people fade away rather than try to keep up with what's going on. It is extremely sad.
Once I found out what was going on with my mom I reached out to a few of her closer friends personally to let them know what was going on. Some had noticed her behavior had changed and one of her closer friends thought my mom was mad at her because my mom stopped answering her calls or calling her back. My mom couldn't keep up with her conversations/remember what she was talking about so my mom slowly withdrew from the people that it made her feel too challenged to talk to. ",1,1

I didn't arrange the evaluation yesterday. My mother was on hospice for a serious colon issue and dementia, and I took her off to put her on a more transitional palliative service. That service requires the dementia test so she won't qualify for services with that evaluation. That's okay, at least in the light of day, but it was frustrating. I guess I need validation!
As for the phone calling. I view perserveration as a little separate form the other dementia behaviors, because it is fueled by anxiety. With my mom, it is as if her brain just doesn't accept and register a response to whatever she is obsessing about and she literally calls about the same think in a minute or two. Twelve times yesterday in 90 minutes.
I have resisted medications at a time when we are minimizing meds as much as we can. But so far removing triggers has helped.
A trigger for her perserveration about checkbook is a grandchild's birthday. Every time one approaches I get calls for the check book and I bring it over, along with a bunch of folders, and tell her she can control her finances. Within hours, she gets overwhelmed and I get more phone calls about what this charge was for, and what that charge was for, and how she needs help with math, etc. etc. until she begs me to take the checkbook again. And then we wait for the next birthday with trepidation.
Everyone says to not answer but honestly the whole thing escalates. And if I don't answer she starts calling my poor kids to see what happened to me, imagining an accident or some disaster. So I mostly answer but when the sequence is that fast, I don't

14416.19,"Is anyone here familiar with Phizer's look at Dimebon (a Russian antihistamine) for it's reported benefits in Alzheimer's patients? Take a good look at the reports on that study and follow the money...... something very suspicious going on there.
I came across this while researching a question on antihistamines on another group, a mitochondrial disease group. Do a search on ""Alzheimer's and mitochondrial dysfunction"", there is a connection.
To make a long story short, I commented on the possibility of cognitive improvement in my answer on the use of antihistamines. Immediately I received enough anecdotal reports on beneficial effects of some few antihistamines when taken in low doses that I started low doses of Benadryl throughout the day. Within 24 hours I saw some rather dramatic improvements in my physical condition and while the cognitive improvements were slower to come, they have been no less dramatic.
Benadryl and Atarax are 1 and 2 in effectiveness and the dosing for both is the same: 1 mg per 15 lbs of body weight every 6 hours (if possible including 1 dose in the middle of the night). Benadryl can be dosed easily by using a measured amount of the children's liquid at 2.5 mg per ml. I take mine diluted.
If anyone is interested I'll post links to my observations and the studies I found that explain what is going on but it boils down to one line in a study published in 1961:
""1. It is shown that a number of antihistamine drugs which prevent liver injury inhibit mitochondrial swelling at concentrations at which they do not affect electron transport or oxidative phosphorylation.""
Translating this you get ""low doses of certain antihistamines inhibit cell death and/or degranulation by inhibiting mitochondrial swelling"".

Does you mother have any whitish looking patches on her tongue or membranes inside her moth and/ or throat?  If so, this could be thrush which makes it extremely difficult to eat or drink.
Does your mother take any meds which cause a significant change in taste?  Some meds cause an extremely nasty metallic taste which can be nauseating.  You can Google this for each med.  
Why not have these items checked out and see if her refusal for oral intake is related to a physical causes and not secondary to dementia.
I would let her eat or drink anything she wants including milk shakes, ice cream, supplements, etc.  It must also be assessed how well the aides are doing when trying to feed her. Does she not like a particular aide, does she not geat adequate slow, kindly input when someone is feeding her?  Is someone actually feeding her at each meal or are trays sometimes or all the time left at the bedside?
If family tries to feed her, is the outcome the same?
Hospice is a choice and they are often very helpful; it must be said that one does not usually put in a feeding tube when Hospice is to come in.

27597.13,"Hi Nancy, 
the wanting to go home does go away after a while.
 what initially helped my grandma was us moving some familiar furniture in, including a large wall unit where we could put all the pictures of relatives that she still recognized and it had drawers she was already used to using. That brought in a familiar element that made it feel more like home. 
The next thing that helped her was receiving cards, flowers and chocolates in the mail from relatives on holidays. Not only did this make her feel special, but because she did get chocolates and cards for her birthday and mothers day, she felt like people knew where she was and helped cement in her mind that she was at home. The aides would show her her name and address on the envelopes and tell her that she did live there because she got mail there. She still has the cards in her room from her birthday (she used to be OCD compulsive throw-out type) so I think the fact that she does not throw out the cards means she probably looks at them from time to time or may not understand how long ago she received it. Either way, that helped her a lot. 
It did take her about 6 months to stop being confused about where she was and ask to come home, but now she thinks she's always lived there! I agree the first month or so is hell with frantic phone calls, demands, threats, crying etc. My parents were totally freaked out.  I like to make the analogy that it's a little like sending a kid off to summer camp where they say they want to come home, but they enjoy it anyway and the parents hear the worst of it but none of the good stuff. The kid secretly has fun but from time to time gets really homesick and thats the only thing the parents hear. 
  You've gotten some good advice to just always be kind and upbeat. Try extending it to ""The doctor says I can bring you home next week"" instead of later int he day or tomorrow, and every time she asks, tell her next week. Then if she does remember it, she'll be remember that it's always next week. Their sense of time gets skewed so use that to your advantage. Your mom may just need a longer length of time to forget. 
  Also, I recently brought my grandma a cabbage patch kids doll which was a super-miracle! I have a post about it from the beginning of august if you want to search for it. You might want to try giving your mom a doll or stuffed animal.  It's done wonders with bringing my grandma's anxiety level down.

22789.8,"Welcome, JF!
  I am so glad you have found us.  You now have a safe place to come for comfort, support, and the information you need to continue on this journey.  It is a hard road, but you are not alone.
  Today is the first anniversary of my mother's passing.  I was her primary caregiver for nearly 7 years.  She spent the last 3 1/2 years in a nursing home and I believe some of those days were among the happiest of her later life.  After my dad passed away, I didn't think my mother would ever be happy again.  But it wasn't always easy.
  There was often the ""going home"" syndrome.  Please feel free to read up on the subject, it is a very common behavior and can be difficult to handle.  There have been many discussions on this forum on the subject.  I usually used some story line that combined truth and sometimes fiction.  The doctor won't let you go home until you are better.  I have to work today, maybe next week I can get some time to move you. The house is torn up right now and the workmen are coming on Monday to fix the heater....
  But I always tried to make our visits special.  I had what I called my ""Mom bag"".  It was one of those canvas bags that I had my initials embroidered on.  In it, I kept most everything I needed for any of our visits.  I had a nail bag with everything I needed for a manicure.  I had a lotion bag with face cream, hand cream, body lotion, lip balm.  I had my notebook where I wrote down changes in medication or changes in her condition, talks I had with nurses or doctors.  I had a hair brush and curling iron.  I often kept a couple magazines while she was able to enjoy them.  I had mail for her that had been delivered to my house.  And I always tried to include a treat for her, fresh fruit, a homemade treat, a muffin from the shop down the street, or a McDonald's sweet tea.
She would often peek into my bag before she properly greeted me because she knew there was something in there for her.
  When the weather permitted, I always took her outside to one of the patios at the facility.  She liked the outdoors and they had some lovely gardens.
  What I didn't do was take her out for other reasons.  We made holidays special at her facility, we never brought her home with us after placing her.  I didn't want to do anything that would prompt that ""going home"" stuff again.  It wasn't about my desire to have her at home, it was about what would keep her as content as possible.
  Let your mother know that you won't tolerate being berated for this move.  If your visit cannot be at least a fairly positive experience, then cut it short.  Stay away for a couple days and try again.  Make it clear that you are leaving because she is being abusive (although you might not want to use that word).  If you focus on the positive and don't let her manipulate the conversation with her demands and rants, things should change.
  Staying positive and presenting a pleasant appearance and attitude was often one of the hardest things for me.  I would often be in tears by the time I started my car up to go home.  But I maintained a smile while I was with her.
  There is a great discussion that I started a couple months ago that may help you a lot.  It's called ""What have you learned from your journey that you think all caregivers should know?""  I will force it to the top of the forum for the many newcomers we have.  There are some great pearls of wisdom in there from many of our members.
  Also, if your eating and sleeping doesn't get better with using some of the advice here on the forum, you should make an appointment for yourself with your doctor.  You don't need to lose your own health due to this situation.
  I'll pass along one great pearl right now from one of our members, in my own words.  Sometimes happy just isn't in the cards.  We have to settle for safe and comfortable.

44192.24,"Well, since the discussion has come up, I'll speak to it. Yes, I am still married. My wife is in a nursing home, and doesn't know that she and I are married (hasn't for close to a year and a half now). Whenever I or anyone else happens to refer to our marriage in her hearing, she becomes angry. She says she ""likes me, but not THAT way"". She does light up when she sees me come to visit. She knows there's SOME kind of relationship there, but isn't too clear on what that relationship actually is.
  For the past several years, until I placed her in the home around the end of Feb., I was her primary caregiver, with invaluable assistance from our daughter, who lived with us. She started to show symptoms around 7 years ago, and over the last few years, her decline accelerated, especially over the past year or two.
  I stood by her and ""held the fort"" for as long as I could. Several people who knew me said they simply couldn't do what I was doing, and that if they were in my shoes, they'd probably have left. Her own family was noticeably absent; a sister visted for a few days a couple of years ago, but we barely heard from them other than that. But I took care of her to the best of my ability, because I love her and I know she would have done the same for me.
   So now, I'm a 56 year old man. I may have another 20-30 years of life left to me, who knows? The marriage I had is, for all practical purposes, over. I'd thought of myself as ""half-widowed"" for a long time; the person Dawn was is no more. Yes, her body is still here, but the woman I fell in love with and made those promises and plans with is not. Am I hurting her by conducting a relationship with someone else, when she herself doesn't even think I'm her husband? I doubt it. Do I need to justify myself to anyone? I don't think so. No, I'm no longer religious, but that's something I don't intend to get into here. I understand that people take comfort in their beliefs, and I have no wish to attack those, but I do not share them.
  Was I looking for another relationship? No. I had considered that I might do so, once Dawn was placed in a home, but this actually did hit me unexpectedly out of the blue; a woman on Twitter with whom I'd had a casual acquaintance because of mutual interests saw one of my tweets about Dawn's condition, and offered to talk about my situation privately if I wanted. I took her up on it, and as we got to talking, I discovered that there was a lot more to her than I realized at first. I found myself developing feelings for her, despite some 1200 miles between us. In turn, she found herself returning those feelings, despite some difficult relationships in the past that had all but convinced her that she didn't want to become involved with anyone ever again. So, we've decided to meet in person and see where this takes us. We don't plan to spend any nights together at this time, we plan on just going out and enjoying each other's company during the days that she's here, and hopefully having some long and deep conversation with each other.
  I do miss feminine companionship, and yes, sex. As her disease progressed, Dawn has been much like a child, and it's been a good year and a half since we were intimate at all, and for the previous 2-3 years, we were only intimate a handful of times at most. I don't feel obligated to remain celibate while Dawn is still alive, since that side of our relationship is over for good. I would never have dreamed of cheating on her before all this happened, but I still have enough life left to live that I don't see why I should be chained to the memory of what we used to have. I won't judge someone else, and if someone judges me, that's up to them.
And with that, I've said all I intend to on the topic. Unless poked further....

There is very little you can do if you are not there.  It sounds like her SO is not your father so without that tie you have even less control over what happens.  My feeling is that you can take the time out of your busy schedule to check on your mother, get paperwork in order, etc. or you can just let things play out.
I know that once my mom was in distress and hundreds of miles away, I had no choice but to fly there and get things under control.  I moved my mom closer to me, but of course that doesn't change the fact she will never get better, but at least I know she is safe and cared for.",0,1

My understanding is that the deciding factor in Memory Care vs. a Skilled Nursing Facility is whether they're ambulatory and how much assistance they need with ADLs. Is that right? Is there any benefit to one over the other? Obviously if he had other medical issues I would imagine SNF would be better, but if he can still feed himself and toilet, is Memory Care a better choice?
TARZY
I was not sure what ""ADL"" means, but Bing told me it was ""Activities of Daily Living."" But to go on.
My wife has been thru them all. Skilled Nursing is for the elderly that need constant attention, often leading to recuperation to the near normal physical health level. Other Skilled Nursing patients may be held at the SNF level unable to care for themselves during ADL,and on there way to expiration.
With Memory Care, be it Elder Care or as the old term was ""Alzheimer Care"" (MC) the deciding authority will be a mix of the POA Next of Kin and the Owner/Manager of the MC Care Facility. Some MC Facilities will take any patient that can fill a bed for the fees involved. Other MC Facilities will judge if the new patient can handle restricted care and daily restricted living without causing excess problems to Staff or other Alzheimer patients.
This is a subject that will only be decided during the ""interview"" you may have with the selected MC Facility. And I do recommend interviews with not less than 4 MC Facilities prior to making your hopeful selection.
If he can toilet and feed himself he is a shoo in for either Elder Care of MC, at the discretion of you and the Facility Owner/Manager.
FYI: Patients expire both in Elder Care and MC. It often depends upon the body organs and the organs health.",0,1

   My mother was moved around a lot. The one hospital that did a wonderful job with her was St. Joseph's in Paterson. It is not a psychiatric hospital.

Explain your situation and see what they can do to help you. They were so kind when my mother was there.
  We did see an elder care attorney. It helped us to get her affairs in order, but he was very expensive. My only other advice is to keep a notebook. Write down what medications she is on, what doctors she sees along with the dates and phone #. I would glue their cards into the book. Write down who to call and anything that you might need to refer back to in the future. This helped us tremendously. You think that you are going to remember it all, but you don't.

26534.13,"Hi,
I'm sorry you are having so many challenges here. I understand the stress of having to make a good choice for doctors and hospitals. I've been there. Ugh!
  I have one little thing to mention to keep in mind. When my mother returned from her last geri psych hospitalizaiton- her nursing home( the one I moved her from) didn't have a provision to accept Medicare for geri psych so her physical therapy wasn't covered by Medicare, but by her own regular part B equivalent( Blue Cross)  So in essence she had to continue to pay for her own room and board while Blue Cross was billed just for therapy.
  Good to check with whatever skilled nursing faclity you use to see if they accept Medicare for geri psych stays. 
  Hang in there!  I know how maddening all of these calls and issues are to have to keep checking up on.
  You know you can always take your mom to an ER at any  hospital I think, regardless of what county it is. If you knew of a good place that also had a geri psych unit you could take your chances and take her to the ER there.
    Who do you think understands your mother's situation the best?  Whatever you do, become best friends with the social worker at the hospital and have them help advocate and communicate on your behalf. Sometimes hospital psych's don't like to talk to families that much, so keep that in mind.

  In my case, my mom's geriatrician wanted me to take her to a geri psych unit where the doctor was suggesting we consider electric shock therapy. I just knew that was a mistake and this doctor, however sure he was that he understood her case, was missing information and understanding about my mother, so I chose to pursue another hospital run by his colleague who had supervised a residents who treated my mother 6 years earlier.  The geriatrician was disappointed that I didn't follow her suggestion, but my gut was that she was not really understanding my mother by this point and was painting an incorrect picture of her.
  Sometimes she just have to go with your gut. Where do you think is the best place? Who will understand her the best?

If it is due to infection, that alone can make a person weaker. Also, ANY time an older adult becomes bedridden for a few days, dementia or not, they lose calcium from their bones, their circulation is not as good, digestion and other systems in his body slow down and he will become weaker.
Lastly, he may now be on some medications for pain (and/or behavioral issues if he has any) which would also cause weakness.
  So for now, give him a little time. Let the doctors find the cause, treat it and let him heal a bit. He should bounce back quite a bit but he will need a few more days than you or I would.

14373.8,"Hello Hammo and a very warm welcome to you. This is indeed a very significant challenge and I can well imagine the stress and frustration this is bringing; I am sorry.
Your description of your wife's condition pretty much depicts that she is beyond the capabiity of managing the finances; yet at this point in time, she has an emotional need to continue on in some way which considering her working life, is understandable. Unfortunately, it appears her ability to use logic, to reason and to use adequate judgment is significantly compromised.
You do mention your discussions with her, the arguments and also how you try to ""convince"" her; all to no avail. Evidently she will not sit with you and pay bills together, so that too is out. Hammo; she is beyond being able to be reasoned with or convinced. That level of understanding and capability is no longer there. This situation is very much like the one in which you could not reason with her, but had to take away her car keys so she could no longer drive. You will have to step up and set boundaries regarding the finances. There will be no way to make her completely happy; but there are ways to try and include her.
As for the threats of divorce, do not worry about this. This sort of comment and threat is often made when a person with dementia at this stage of disease is very frustrated or cannot get their own way. A small child would threaten to take their toys and not play with you anymore. The threat of divorce in this way at this stage is the adult way of not wanting to play anymore.
I can share that we had a very similar situation with my mother. Oh boy; it was a rocky road. Some bills paid three times, some only partial payment others skipped and not paid and the checkbook was a mess. Yet; she railed against anyone helping her.
Finally, this is what we had to do. All payments that could go on auto debit to be paid automatically through the bank was done. It does NOT go on a credit card; the payment request goes to the bank from the billing entity, and it automatically comes out of your account; whichever one you want it to come out of, and you get a statement in the mail.
Secondly, I see you are in a rural area which makes getting from one point to another for services a little difficult. But; if you can obtain a Post Office Box or a UPS Postal Box for mail, you can change all the addresses for your billing for all accounts including the doctor, and your wife will never see the bills.
But what about your wife and her focus on this; how can she be accommodated in some way. What we did for our Loved One, (LO), was to take the bill paying checkbook so she would not have access to it. I then opened another checking account in her name and mine. I had only her name printed on the checks. That checking account was kept at a very low balance. It never went over $400 and stayed mostly between $200 and $400. I cancelled overdraft protection as I did not want her writing checks that would be large as she tended to spend. I would rather pay an overdraft fee rather than have hefty amounts of money transferred from savings into checking to make up the shortfall.
I monitored the accounts on the computer each day and could see who she wrote checks to and for what. Minor things. I also transferred additional funds from savings into her checking account online when it got low.
Tess's idea of your wife using that account to donate small amounts to church or charities is a good one. My mother paid for her haircuts, for a lady we had who came to help clean, and other minor things. Then she kept track of it in a little book. Did a bad job of it, but to her it was peachy keen. Once she had her own checking account, she no longer fussed about the banking like she used to do.
BUT . . . . . as time moved forward and her condition continued to advance; we had big trouble that surfaced. She suddenly began to try and plunder the savings accounts. She even called the bank and had them process moving money and had a care aide take her to the bank where she withdrew $7,000. I found it hidden in the bottom of the dirty clothes hamper. Shock!!
Step-dad was worried sick about it. Finally, out of desperation, we went to the bank without her knowing and closed the current accounts except her small checking account and immediately opened them under step-dad's name and my name. We took Mom's name completely off the accounts but did leave them payable to her upon death of step-dad and me. It was a necessity.
She not only had her small checkbook, I also ensured she had about $20 or so in her wallet in one's or a five and some one's (it made it look and feel like more.)
There will not be a way to make your wife happy with all of this. She is not happy now, but you need to protect yourselves and she cannot do that any longer; only you can. It is not about ""happy,"" it is about financial safety.
NOTE: It would be a good idea to have her seen by a dementia expert if she has not seen one. What type of dementia is at hand is important as there are multiple different types and treatment for one type may be contraindicated in another and make things worse. AND . . . after assessment, the specialist may be able to write you a letter on letterhead that your wife is no longer competent to format her own plan of care and further, is no longer competent to manage her business and finances. This then will help you if push comes to shove and you need to show such a letter to a bank or other institution. That happened once with us and I was glad that both the Neurologist and the primary care MD had written such letters so I could produce them without major problem issues.
Hammo; by taking the reins in this you are not doing something TO your wife; you are doing something FOR her. You will not be doing anything behind her back; you will have her back and are protecting both of you.
If you think on this there may be ways she can track things from her checkbook and also, perhaps you or some acquaintances or family can find a way to help refocus her and keep her mind occupied on other topics and other pursuits or small easy activities. Refocusing and keeping her busy would help to diminish the obsession with the bookkeeping and the checkbook.
I send you my very best wishes; I do understand how difficult this is for you. If it is of any comfort, as the disease progresses, this fixation will diminish and fall away. Please let us know how you are doing; we will be thinking of you and we truly do care.

  You can ask them to tell you about their home and what they liked best about it.  You can look at pictures of her home if you have any.  You can tell her she is home with you and you enjoy having her for company very much.
  You can take her for a ride in the car, go a few blocks away and come back and say, ""we're home now.""
  You can tell her, you'll give her a ride home tomorrow in the morning when the weather is better, or when your car gets fixed.
  If this is a new behavior, you may want to take her to see her doctor to check for a urinary tract infection which can sometimes make the person be more agitated and confused.

10805.8,"Hey deedsypoof,
First of all, I am SO sorry you're going through this too. However, you are definitely not alone. I just turned 22 and I'm also faced with taking care of my mom, who has had an EO diagnosis at just 55. I'm also in college and already going through a lot, so I totally understand how shitty it is to have all of this suddenly thrown in your lap. I am rooting for you!!!!
I'm new to this whole thing too, so I may not be much help, but I sure as heck want to at least try to help you in some way.
1) I think it's a good idea to consult a professional. For example, I called a memory care facility and spoke with their head manager, and she was able to give me tons of helpful advice. They can even give you tips on how to get your mom to cooperate better with the planning process. If I were you, I'd find a memory care facility near you (Idk which ones they have out there in CA), and speak with someone, like I did, and ask them this question. They will be happy to help you, and it doesn't mean that you HAVE to use that specific facility. They are honestly there to help people who are going through this. They understand how hard this is, and they will be there for you. They also have support groups that they can hook you up with.
2) Do her sisters live in CA as well? I know they are not close to you guys, but they are her SISTERS, I would still at least TRY to get into contact with them. Tell them your situation, and ask them for help in some way--you're gonna NEED it. Please do NOT be afraid to ask ANYONE for help. If they do not want to help you, then that is on THEM. They will have to live with that, and they WILL answer for it, I promise you (no offense to your aunts, I am just very angry about people not helping). If her sisters will not step up and help you guys out, I would then suggest taking advantage of a daycare for adults. There are places that will allow you to leave your mom (temporarily) whenever you cannot be with her, and then you can come pick her up, just like a children's daycare. For example, I know of a facility called ""A Place For Mom"", and there are probably a ton of different places like that. Another option I can think of is maybe you could get a job that allows you to work from home. That way, you can still work and still be at home with your mom. Also, you could try reaching out to a church group that might have some resources available to help you. I know a lot of churches do volunteer work like that sometimes. Also, take advantage of online classes! That's what I'm currently doing.
3) I have experienced lots of guilt too. However, you will get more and more patient as time goes on. I remember when my mom first got diagnosed, I suddenly felt overwhelmingly guilty about every single fight we have ever had. You know what though? It is pointless. Does it define your mother-daughter relationship? NO. Does it change a thing? NO. Does it mean you love her any less? NO. If anything, I believe that fighting is a crucial part of a close, meaningful relationship. Fighting is passion. People who have never had a fight, are people who are not TRULY close enough. That is what I truly believe because I have seen this firsthand, and I believe it wholeheartedly. Your mom worked those 2 jobs to take care of you and make sure you had nothing but the best, and now the roles have switched and you have to do the same for her. Try to establish a process of keeping your cool, even when it's the hardest. I am (still) learning how to pick my battles wisely with my mom. For example, leave the room and count to 10. In that time, compose yourself and remind yourself that your mom is not the same person anymore. She will no doubt get under your skin like never before. They say that the person's usual temperament is amplified, so if they were difficult before, it's gonna be difficult times 2! But you have a VERY important job to do, and that is to keep the peace and make this time with your mom as enjoyable as possible. Remember, you don't want to look back and regret things you've said to her, or wish you had acted differently. Some things are just not. worth. it. One of the best things you can do is learn to hold your tongue, and just agree with her even when she's wrong (unless the thing is dangerous or something).
Please do not feel guilty about wanting to live your life. I want to live my life too, and that is how you're SUPPOSED to feel when you're in your 20s. Yes, take care of your mom and be there for her all you can! But, please do NOT forget to take care of yourself!!!!!
Please make sure you are finding time to exercise, eat a brain-healthy diet, take brain/memory supplements, manage your stress, go to support group, go to counseling (a lot of universities have FREE counseling!!), do FUN things that you enjoy, spend time with your mama, and try to maintain a positive outlook on the future.",1,1

Not good time to have to make such choices.  It lasted about 5 years and did go off once but the pacemaker part was always fighting my heart because I have a rhythm problem.  It required lots of visits but not anything to make it better.  The medicine that I am on can make the rhythm problems too.  I would really think hard before having one put in a person with dementia.
  One part that spoke to me in the book was about how people with spouses with dementia may not wear their wedding rings because they feel that the person they married are no longer there.  Doesn't mean they would cheat or anything, just how they deal with it in their minds.

28200.18,"When my wife entered the MCH 5 months ago one of the things I signed was an OK for EMT resuscitation.  At that time it seemed like the thing to do; she was still quite lucid.  At what point does this change?  I surely don't know.  I am sure, however, if the EMT unit had to be called in the middle of the night the aides would not go running for the paperwork.

I'm not sure when I would change the paperwork but it is something I will have to keep in mind, although I doubt that it would be checked in the time of need.  

EMTs are trained to resuscitate and transport, that is what they do. Dr.s and nurses are also trained to try to heal, at least in most cases.  That is why we family caregivers have to be ready to intervene.  I have read somewhere that it isn't so difficult to keep hydration and feeding tubes from being connected but it is very hard to get them removed.

I am so sorry that you had to find this out Marg.  This information serves no purpose but to distress.  My prayers continue for you.

First her synthyroid dose was tweaked, then she was put first on generic zoloft - a low dose, then buspirone was added (which was titrated up to 30 mg/day - 10mgx3), and finally generic aricept at a low dose.  The combination has effectively stabilized her moods for over a year now without sedating her.  Once the drug combo was in place, all behavioral issues have responded to environmental and non-drug remedies (i.e. staff approaches etc.).  Before the geripsychiatrist we had a hellish transition week where my mother was started on a different medication (benzodiazepines) at the prompting of her new facility to primary care drs, to which she had an extreme reaction but which the facility kept coming back to until they kicked her out, coincidentally on the day she was first scheduled to see the geri-psychiatrist.
 My mother was 85 when she was diagnosed by her small town dr. as moderately severe dementia, apart from ER visits she has never been evaluated by a neurologist, so she didn't have advanced diagnostic tests like MRIs or spinal taps, she did have extensive bloodwork and CAT scans (after falls).  She is beyond neuropsychological testing but has had speech therapy services.  At 88, she is currently under the treatment of a primarily palliative care dr./nurse practitioner team and a geriatric psychiatrist, both practices have an extensive geriatric/dementia practice. The geri psych calls it probable alzheimer's, the GP calls it moderately severe dementia, possibly alzheimer's.

It's Sunrise Senior Living and they have places all over the US and in Canada and the UK.  They run their places very differently than other NH's, IMO.  There are no uniforms and they are careful about the language used so it feels like a home environment.  The memory care unit was awesome - and very homelike  and everyone gets a lot of attention and they are busy all day. They have different workstations for the Alz patients with things like baby doll therapy.  They even use yellow Fiestaware plates to help the patients with the vision distortions that go with Alz so they can enjoy their food more.  The dining room had lots of yellow and red - colors known to stimulate the appetite.  They've thought of everything!  What I noticed most of all was how engaged the employees were with the residents - and everyone looked happy and had stuff to do.  Website is sunriseseniorliving dot com.  You can see if they have a facility near you.  In their assisted living area, I saw the caregivers bring in their folks for an afternoon snack of spinach and artichoke dip and chips or cookies and the caregivers were going all out to make sure everyone got whatever they wanted to eat and drink.  Because the caregivers know what each person's diet is, they also act as their waiters and waitresses.  Very interesting concept that seems to work very well. 
  I've visited 4 local facilities so far and there really is quite a difference between them. At one facility, in the memory care unit, the patients were out in the common areas but just left to entertain themselves.  The staff wore medical uniforms and although they tried to make it look pretty, it was not very homelike at all.

It's not about enabling anymore.  That's not the point at all.  Your father will continue to do what he wants to do even not being able to.  At this point, you just take over.  Changes have to be made. ""Dad, I will not listen to this anymore...this is how it's going to be, because I love you...and that's that.""  
If your father ends up falling and knocking his head himself or God forbids what else, then what?  They cannot be alone.  Your father, as you know, should not be taking care of your mom anymore.  It has to be someone else.  Either in a facility, or as someone else here mentioned, 24/7 care at home.
I'm mid-age, rather healthy, but this is such a load of a job taking care of my father.  And yes, I'm getting tired and it seems more dragging with these shorter days lately.
I have help, but I take over as soon as I return from work, and throughout the night for diaper changes/grooming.  He and I are alone on the weekends.  He cannot walk on his own, brush his teeth, eat on his own, shave his face, I bathe him in bed, he doesn't assist me at all with anything.  Rolling him in bed, he does not help me at all.  All the load is on my body.  No matter what instructions given to him, forget it.  The caregiver does absolutely everything.

We are already being advised to self-quarantine, use social distancing, and follow all the other recommendations. I work in a childcare facility, and am considered an essential worker.  Unless we are closed down, I will need to continue working. I am staying home when not at work. Our local stores have set aside the first hours of their day for elderly and medically compromised shoppers; if I absolutely have to go to the store, I do so in the evenings. The stores have been virtually empty at 8 pm. Unfortunately, I've heard reports of people crowding stores earlier in the day, standing shoulder to shoulder, and the beaches were filled with visitors who were in no way observing social distancing. Because of the crowded situation, the coastal towns are closing their doors to visitors. 
I'm sorry, too, Army Vet, that the cemetery was closed to visitors. I don't understand, either, how some places can be so full of people in close contact but a place like a cemetery can be closed.

  Hospice can also provide P.T. for their patients.  This too is written into the federal policies and can be used to restore or to maintain function.  So, that may be an option if you want to plug Hospice in while maintaining P.T. services.

""It's free,"" Peter replied, ""this is Heaven.""

Next they went out back to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth.

The old man asked, ""what are the green fees?"".

Peter's reply, ""This is heaven, you play for free.""

Next they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine's of the world laid out.

It's not cheap but she has dealt with issues we've been having with the rehab facility, keeping the elder care lawyer assessed on the issues we are having, recommending doctors and ALF places (there are a lot of ALF's in our area of varying quality).  She is also providing documentation for the neuro appointment by reading records from all the hospitals my MIL has been in. My husband and I don't have the time or knowledge to comb through 3 months of hospital records to find what is needed.  She will also help us try to activate my MIL's LTC insurance.

  We have been told some of the money will be refunded to us by the LTC plan for the GCM.  I can see how it may not be necessary especially if they won't make recommendation for doctors or you don't need recommendations for ALF's or help activating insurance.  
  I think the decision to use a GCM is both financial (we are lucky that the LTC will pay us back for the service) and personal based on the complexity of the decisions you need to make.

41467.15,"Good afternoon all. LJ, I live in Western Colorado. The picture was taken on top of a mountain near our home. I have never hiked to the top, but several people hike up there. For as long as I can remember, we have had a cross that lights up just above where the man was standing on the rock. They light it for two weeks at Easter, Christmas, Thanksgiving. I can see the cross from my deck, and it sits overlooking the town. The sun must have been setting just right to capture all those beautiful colors. I wish I could take credit for the picture, but it was taken by a local restaurant owner. It is a popular attraction around here. Most of the locals have climbed Mt. Sopris to the top at some point in their lives. I've never done that either. Too many huge boulders to get over.

Windy and cloudy again here today. We were supposed to get showers, but I think they are moving East and avoiding us.

Lorita, the pendant is beautiful. Just the right size and I love how she put Ray's initials on the side. I would love her phone number if you don't mind sharing. I want to get some made for the kids and one for me.

So happy to hear Liam is better. Such good news.

LJ, I used a fingerprint kit to get Harv's fingerprints. You can find them at Hobby Lobby and sometimes Walmart. I got mine from Cremation Solutions. You can also just use an ink pad and white paper. That's all the kids have in them anyway. I took about 10 and made them dark and light so I would be sure one of them would work.

I was going to share an article that one of my friends who moved to Santa Fe, NM sent me. She moved there with her husband who has Alz. to be closer to her kids. I can hardly read the article she sent, and I know if I resize it, it won't be large enough to read. She found it in a copy of Bark Magazine at her vet's office. It was about service dogs trained to help Alz. patients. Very interesting. I didn't check online to see if I could find it, but if anyone is interested, maybe you can find it.

Dd, I am hoping your winter is over for this year. Seems like you northerners had a really tough go of it this year. I bet you are thinking 60 degrees feels like mid summer. Nice you could get out and take a walk in the sun with your dog.

We, is lemon balm tea the same as lemon tea? I have chamomile, but want to try the lemon balm too. I have trouble going to sleep.

Leanne, I hope you are having a great time with your family.

Twink, I saw storms coming your way yesterday. Sure hope it wasn't more snow.

Guess I better get off here and get a few things done. I need to get a walk in today. I vowed I would exercise 6 days a week for awhile, so need to keep working toward my goal.

46531.39,"Hello again, everyone,
  I couldn't let any more time go by without responding to some of the pressing issues here, such as naming Lorita's dog, and straightening Johanna out re horse breeds and submitting my prize-winning nickname: Doris Dingleschmear! Top that if you dare.
  The funeral was Friday AM after an evening of visiting hours at the funeral home. It's been a difficult few days, and I've slept a lot since, trying to catch up on three nights on death watch and the attendant grief. I'm still weary, but have a ton of things to do, people to notify, generous friends to thank, etc.
  For the funeral, I had to find a minister who knew my husband well, because our minister was retiring and had many farewell ceremonies over the weekend. So I asked the son of one of the NH residents, the woman who thought DH was her late husband. (If you recall, DH thought Emelie was his wife and Shirley thought DH was her husband, and the tree of them sat side by side at the dinner table, for a whole new take on the menage-a-trois.)
  I could not have made a better choice; nobody could possibly have done a better job of interweaving his recent knowledge of DH with all the family stories, with a bit about the sadness of dementia itself. And Emelie's daughter came to the funeral too! DH's best friend from childhood spoke at the service as did our son, a son-in-law, and a granddaughter - all tear-jerkers.
  DH chose to be buried in the nearby veterans' cemetery, and wow! Between the honor guard attendants, the three gun salute, the playing of Taps, and the presentation of the folded flag from the coffin to me, I was a quivering mass of tears. Undaunted, I'm planning to go back today to find his grave and say a Fathers' Day prayer for him. Though I never have believed in this omen, when I went out to get the paper this morning, there was a bright penny in the middle of the driveway.  So much for skepticism.
  Thank all of you for your kind thoughts and good wishes. I appreciate the closeness that this board engenders. Now for the important stuff: Lorita, I too vote for Bella, because surely she is beautiful. And Johanna, there are many breeds of horses, but those most often used as racehorses are Thoroughbreds, who race under saddle in such races as the recent Belmont Stakes; our breed, Standardbreds, who race pulling sulkies and are represented by such leading lights as Dan Patch and Paul Revere's horse. Bonnie's Arabian horses sometimes race too, but are most known for their beauty, as in The Black Stallion. Larger breeds, aka draft horses, were used as war horses in medieval times and beer advertisements, like the Clydesdales, now on TV.
  All for now - back to my thank you notes. And thank YOU for being here!",1,1
46608.1,"Oh Jim, I am so sorry for what you are experiencing; what a stressful time.  It is quite evident that you are an excellent advocate for your wife and a very compassionate husband who is trying to do his very best on her behalf.
  I am an RN whose mother had FrontoTemporal Dementia and whose step-dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.  I too experienced an involuntary  GeroPsych admission for my mother.
  From what you have written, it does sound as though your wife may well have had one of those small strokes that are called a, TIA - ""transient ischemic attack.""  In a TIA, there is stroke activity, but the symptoms usually clear within a 24 hour period.
  SunnyCA has written a good synopsis of what may have occurred and regarding the medication.  Because of the overwhelming fulminant behaviors, Haldol was used.  It was appropriate to do so to assist not just with her acting out to those around her; but to completely calm the crisis behavior which could have affected her physical condition as another stroke could have occurred secondary to the severity of those overwhelming behaviors.  This was important.
  Because the behavioral issues persisted, the psychiatrist was called in regarding the dementia behaviors.  That order would have been written by the primary care MD.  The primary admitting MD would have still been in charge.  Because you mentioned you have been trying to get your wife to GeroPsych for some time, this then worked to that end.  At the time of admission or any time during the hospital stay, had you discussed with anyone, nursing, doctor, etc., about your wife's ongoing behavioral issues at home?  Did you at any time mention GeroPsych in any way?
  Your wife would not have been able to be transferred to a GeroPsych Unit without medical clearance from the MD(s) handling the TIA issues that she was stable for said transfer - that cannot be done any other way.  Medical MDs control all.  Without the assessment and statement that your wife was ""stable for transfer,"" it would never have been done.
  Your wife was being admitted to GeroPsych without her personal consent; therefore, the ""involuntary"" admission was done because she could not give said consent.  That is the law - the admission must be ""involuntary.""  The initial involuntary admission is on a 72 hour basis.  You can indeed have her discharged to your care if this is what you really and truly want IF this admission is not in your wife's best interests.  Sometimes, if you wish to remove her, this must be with signing an ""Against Medical Advice"" (AMA) form; other times not.  AND she must have a safe place to go to.  That would be your home which would be a safe place as there is no abuse taking place and at home she has good care.
  Initially, the restricted visiting hours are considered necessary as the patient needs to be very, very closely assessed with no outside influences or disruptions which can change the patient's behaviors as well as disrupting a very structured process.  If this is a huge issue for you, do speak with the psychiatrist and if he feels it will not be a negative, he can write an order for you to be able to visit your wife more frequently, but I doubt it will be carte blanche and that too is appropriate.  Psych units are NOT medical floor units.
  Also - do make contact with the psychiatric social worker on the unit; she/he will be very helpful and can assist you, explain things well and can become an advocate for you and your wife.  I always suggest making this person your ""new best friend.""  Psych Units are so different from regular medical floor dynamics that initially it may be difficult to understand what's going on and why.  You can (and should) begin to discuss discharge planning arrangements with the social worker for when your wife is to be discharged.
  There is no coroner involved in the care; this may have been a typo or a blurred word on the paper, thus making the misunderstanding.  Coroners are involved in deaths and this is not what you are dealing with.
  Any extension of involuntary stay past the initial 72 hours, is usually done in a team meeting with the psychiatrist, nursing, social worker and someone from the county that is a psychiatric worker to represent the patient's interests in continuing to need to be there on a psychiatric necessity basis.  This is to ensure the patient's rights at not being held unnecessarily for no reason.  Also, Medicare or other insurance will look at this too to ensure medical necessity for their reimbursement for care.
  You do say that you had been wanting to have your wife admitted to GeroPsych for some time; you mention the psychiatrist having an excellent reputation; you mention what a lovely place the GeroPsych Unit is and how well staffed - this sounds like a real positive.
  Your wife will adapt to the Unit; you too must have a period of adaptation - it is like being a stranger in a strange land; this is not the usual medical care floor, it is psychiatric which has different rules required by law and the dynamics and process are different and it can raise some concerns and even fears.
  If this were me, and of course you are not me; I would give myself breathing space today, Sunday.  Tomorrow, Monday or when can, I would contact the social worker and introduce myself and make an appointment for a face to face meeting . . . I would also contact the psychiatrist and calmly express my concerns, ask about the care and treatment plan, and request him to write an order giving you additional visiting time IF it is not going to disrupt your wife's care . . . personally, I would not ask for more than one more hour.  After all; it has been difficult getting your wife to GeroPsych, and you will want it to be as effective as possible.
  These are emotionally difficult times and we as loving caregivers suffer greatly watching what is happening.  It also makes us feel helpless, hopeless and impotent not to be able to ""make things better"" and we feel dis-ease when everything is out of our hands.
  Learning to let go for bits of time are the most difficult lessons to learn and it was certainly so for me.  However, you are still there, still looking out for her and keeping a close watch on all.
  Do communicate with the professionals and make appointments for face to face meetings with that social worker.  Also, you can indeed call nursing and check up on your wife and how she is doing when you are not there. 
  I send you my very, very best wishes during these trying times and so hope your wife will be able to be helped.  AND, if necessary, the primary care MD may also make a visit or visits to the present Unit if needed.  You can also discuss the stroke history with the psychiatrist AND the charge nurse so that you can feel reassured no one is missing that important piece of information to be used in their observations and assessment of your dear wife.
  Please let us know how you are doing, we are thinking of you and we truly do care.

 At first I would go see my Dad everyday,sometimes twice a day.
Always ended way bad,With him mad,me mad then me crying and leaving then the guilt because I got mad.
His new care home said walk away from him and leave. So I started doing that.
They also said for me not to come everyday,because he blames me for him being there.
Care home also said it was stressing me out and that they could see it.
Wearing 2 different shoes one day didnt help my case of sayin No Im fine.
Neither did the fact that some days I would just stare at the sign in book and they would jokingly tell me your name is Susan...
  They also will not let him call me all day long. Sometimes they tell him the line is busy and they will try again,when he walks away they will call and ask me if its ok for him to call.
  They assured me they will not kick him out.
He is doing better with not asking to come home.

She is so tiny, so helpless, it is so sad.  Please don't feel bad for wishing her to pass, that's not wrong, its real and compassionate.  I pray often that God would take my mom, knowing of course that He knows best, but I can ask.  It's hard to watch this very slow decline, very hard.  Our hospice nurse tells us too that dementia can take a loooong time.  It is taking a loooong time.  None of this disease has been easy on her or us, each stage very hard, so I guess it stands to reason that this end stage will be hard too.  At least we'll be able to understand others having gone through it all.     
I keep hearing that it may be the calm before the storm, or the rally before the end, but she just keeps doing it.  I, too, am weary of thinking this is it and my emotions going all over the place.  We are all telling each other that when she has a bad day, it's just a bad day, it doesn't mean anything.  Trying to get used to the roller coaster of emotions.

There are some that take a very lassez faire approach, perhaps that helped you cope with your own loved one, but if I had listened to the naysayers my mother would have been lost on multiple occasions because of medication issues among other things. I think it's a little presumptious to assume it's the dementia alone when you don't have the full picture. Could this be dementia alone? Maybe, will I adjust yes, but there are always more factors to consider. Thanks for sharing your experience w the Lasix. (Isn't that a blood thinner?)

  Here in California as in most states, Financial Abuse is in the same penal code sections as is physical and mental abuse.
  Once you read that, or even if you do not read; you can contact the Adult Protective Services for the county in which your husband is now residing and state your concerns and ask that a case worker be assigned to assess the matter.
  APS must go out and conduct an actual in-person assessment within a certain amount of time; usually 24 - 48 hours.  They can keep your name confidential.
  Even though you mentioned you had filed for divorce, this does not keep you from requesting APS from conducting an evaluation if you feel there is financial or other abuse happening.

12381.3,"Hi Mari
   Welcome to the forum. There are lots of problems here and it would help to get a bit more information from you in order to offer more specific suggestions.
     Can you tell me the age of your step-dad? Has he ever had a complete dementia workup by a neurologist or geriatric psychiatrist, or did his doctor tell you he thought he had dementia due to the strokes.
   You say he has always been verbally aggressive. Do you know if this is associated with alcohol? 
     How did he threaten your mom?
Please only answer what you are comfortable with. No one HAS to share more than that, but the answers might help with solutions.
   I'd like to discuss this in general, starting with your mom's safety since that is most important.
For any caregiver who has a LO with serious aggressive tendencies, it is important to be prepared in case something bad does happen. The person with dementia is not thinking clearly. Memory and cognition have been impaired. Restraint of anger is difficult, if not impossible, so it is important for your mom to think about protecting herself. This means, as kelantol said, removing the dangerous items to where he will not find them or locking them up. Knives, scissors, guns, if he has any.  Mom should also carry a charged cell phone at all times and there should be a secure room she can retreat to and lock herself in if he goes after her.
   If your dad physically threatens your mom in ANY way, she should call 911 and let her know he has dementia and is threatening her. The police will come and take him to the ER where they will assess him and probably send him to a geriatric psych unit. There, they will monitor his behaviors and if needed, medicate him to help with his aggression.
   From there, it is likely that the psych unit will advise placement. A social worker can help with this, but it would be best if you (and your mom is possible) can gather information on facilities with MC units in your area.
     It would also be best if you and your mom can visit an elder law attorney who can help someone get POA for your step dad, and look at his resources to see if he can afford long term care and if not, what help he might be entitled to.
     You have not mentioned whether he has family in the area or not. Perhaps they can be of help in some of this. Sometimes this helps, and other times it only makes things worse. But you need to think about this.
   As far as his driving, your mom will probably be held liable if he gets into an accident and hurts someone, as she is aware that he has dementia and was told not to drive. In many cases families disable the car or have it removed to ""be repaired"".  Perhaps your mom would be willing to do this if you helped her shop once or twice a week.
    There is some information I'd like to give you for new forum members regarding dementia care. Here is the link:  https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147523850
Most helpful will be ""Understanding the dementia experience"" which will give you an idea of what your step-dad is going through, and what he needs. Please also read  ""Communication skills"" which demonstrates a good way to communicate with him by encouraging his  cooperation  and reducing  the chance of negative behaviors.
   Scroll down a bit to find information on finding a facility. Irregardless of what he wants, your step-dad has dementia and is exhibiting symptoms that may not allow him to remain at home. Better to be prepared in case he does need to be in a facility.
    The other links will be more applicable, and very helpful as your step-dad's dementia progresses.
It is also important for you to use the 800 number at the National Alz. Assoc. if you run into problems we can't help with. The 24/7 Helpline is: 1.800.272.3900
 I hope this information is helpful,
 Please let us know how your step-dad is doing and what you and mom have decided. The forum can give you a lot of information and support and there are many ears here willing to listen if you need to vent.

  From all you have posted and your profile it appears that you are in a difficult position.
  First things first....the ostrich approach is not successful...others can attest to that. Your father has not been diagnosed. This must be done. Dementia can be caused by AD but other things which can be easily treated as well. The alz.org site is very thorough about the process. Again, this must be done.  

  Next...your mother. She needs help. Talking to you about abandoning your father, killing herself and her sex problems with your father must be unsettling at the least. It must be her desperateness talking but it would be best if she talked to a professional. 

Next...you are important. Only you can decide how important your marriage is but you have the option to not take your father in. If you choose to have him with you you must plan for things other than day help. Your will need have him give you DPOA and you need to understand CLEARLY everything financial that involves your father.

Being responsible for a person is not merely seeing to their physical safety. YOu will be responsible for more and  more if your father is diagnosed with any kind of dementia.

Since you don't know what the diagnosis is (and haven't even told us how old your parents are or their physical status) I think Macy is jumping the gun a little.
Perhaps you can see if you can get a waver to see your parents medical record. Then ask the neuro to send his reports to the GP and see if you can get a recommendation from him. Sometimes, I think, doctors want to cover themselves. Also, a recommendation is not an absolute. It's a recommendation.
So while I'm asking you to seek more info, keep in mind that whatever happens if you take away the driving you have to substitute it with someone who is willing to take them where they want to go. Obviously they are not willing to sit at home.

The Alzheimer's Assn. has a Helpline at (800) 272-3900.  There are no fees for this service.  If you call, please ask to be transferred to a Care Consultant. Consultants are highly educated Social Workers who specialize in dementia and family dynamics.  They can be very supportive listeners, have much information, and can also assist in our problem solving.
Since you are out of state, if there are sufficient assets, there is assistance in the form of a, Certified Geriatric Case Manager.  Here is a link; look on the side margin for more information:
(Click Here)
You can also use Google to search, Certified Geriateric Case Managers inserting the area in which your mother lives.  This will bring up names.
I personally would want a Care Manager that is Certified, and one that has two years of experience or more, and I would prefer the individual be either a social worker or RN.
These individuals can manage so much and are very helpful when family is at a distance.  They can also attend doctor's appointments, plug in a variety of services including hiring aides and conduct oversight reporting back to the family.   It is pricey.  The first visit which is a lengthy assessement visit costs more. After that, cost is by the hour and charges vary hugely from one Certified Case Manager to another and in one area to another.

  Even before the 13.3 mg  patch came out (just in the past year)  I changed my husband (EOAD) to a combo of the 9.5 plus the 4.6 mg patches (funny how that does not add up to 13.3 mg), because I had seen the preliminary results of the 13.3 mg trials.

44955.7,"  Hate to hear about any one having ALS. My mother had a variant - primary lateral sclerosis.  She lived 16 years from first symptoms which isn't unusual for PLS, but ALS goes much faster.  When my mom died (of sepsis from a bowel perforation) she could move her head and right arm slightly.  But her mind was completely there.  I'm not sure which is worse - both are awful.
  Tomorrow my daughter and I are taking Jim to see the State Vet's home.  He's less interested than he was, but I think he needs to see that it's an okay place.  I've copied pages and pages of financial stuff, and when they offer a bed, once that is worked out, I have 5 days to decide.  And it could be as early as next week.  So I'm a basket case and still coughing and wheezing from bronchitis.  There is no right decision, but I'm getting so tired.  As I said before, the home is quite close, 15 minutes away, so that isn't an issue.  He'll be in the personal care or skilled nursing wing. 
  This whole thing just plain sucks.  He's started to have some hallucinations now, or else they are dreams he thinks are real.  So far they are harmless and not like his delusions which mostly he seems to have forgotten. I wish I could.  He has no interest at all in the new car - hasn't even seen it yet.  Doesn't seem to care that I bought it.  So unlike he used to be.  
  Enough of all of that.  Hopefully tomorrow will go okay, especially with my daughter there.  Mentally I was figuring this would have to come about by summer, but maybe this is the time.  And it's going to snow - - Carolyn",0,1

With Alzheimers he began having more than two beers. And he was taking Ariceot and Flomax.  At that time I spoke with his doctor and we decided it was one of his pleasures left and eventually he would forget about beer too so we agreed not to change things yet. Then it was like beer was the only thing he recognized in the frig and he started drinking earlier in the afternoon and would get really angry if I objected.
 
There were two dangerous incidents where he got drunk. Once he hurt himself, once he punched me. That was the day I locked up the beer and found a source for non-alcoholic beer. I asked the store manager to stock more so I didn't have to drive all over town.  I was surprised that it only took a couple of days for him to accept the O'Douls.",0,1

It is those little moments that remind us He is with us, knows our hearts and hears our prayers.  
I agree with everyone here that caregiving is the hardest thing I have ever done.  There is no help for the burden of responsibility, the overwhelming load of being ""on duty"" 24/7  even if we are away (like GwenS). When I took my mom to my sister's last summer...  we stayed 5 days with her to help mom make the transition and to help my sister ease into FT care. I was kind of irritated that she put my mom into adult daycare (because it would be best for mom...... right).  I have no issue with daycare. I support it actually.  However, she was only going to have her for 3 weeks. We were with her the first five days!!!  It just aggravated me that she was not spending all that time with mother.  Is that petty? On top of that, she expected mom to pay for the daycare.  On top of that, she called me every day we were gone to complain about mom!!!!  Yikes and away. I wanted to get away!!!!!  
     Mom is in a NH now.  As many of you can attest, the 24/7 care is relieved and I am grateful... but the responsibility never goes away.  Thankfully, I am 5 minutes away. I am able to go up there 2 or 3 times a day if I need to. My world still revolves around mom... how she is feeling... did she eat... has she been crying and or agitated... how her meds are working, or not.... whether she has a UTI.... and yesterday... I walked in and her face was flushed, she was wet and sweating all over because she had a fever!!!!  ( it came on suddenly, I had been with her just hours before.  The staff jumped immediately into action and couldn't have been more helpful but holy moly!  What happened?)

I would suggest a geriatric care manager to look in on her and do an assessment on the appropriate level of care. Assisted living means a couple checks throughout the day to ensure your loved one is okay. However, if a resident chooses to skip meals or isolate themselves, there likely aren't additional resources unless you fund a helper to be with your mom in the mornings or afternoons. Realize this illness gets worse and many would say it is key that your mom lives very close to you. We use a very strong memory care; however, especially initially, I was there many times during the week when there was difficulty. Investigate the legal, power of attorney, etc.--both financial and medical. The helper would be great at the doctor; however, you really need the ability to understand the exact diagnosis and care plan. Your helper wouldn't have the ability to gain this information.

I'm a nurse, not a prescriber, and my DH is significantly older than yours.  His behavioral symptoms of dementia are more ""routine"" (agitation & depression) than what you describe.

Not only is all this tiring for you, it has to be, at some level, exhausting for him.  Every time he thinks about it, he must feel terrified that he might be as vulnerable as he imagines.  It would be worth the conversation and even if the medication only works for a while -- circumstances might change and you'll be facing an entirely different picture in 6 months or a  year.
We (MD at my request) started my hubby on a tiny dose of antidepressant when I would find him repeatedly awash in tears (no specific reason, he just felt terribly sad).  It was a god-send for about 18 months.  Then, my hubby began being aggressive and verbally rude with people who have been very generous to him.  He would be irritated in ordinary conversation and turn a simple dinner event into a whirlwind of his own fury.  Once again, just a conversation with his MD and we changed to a different medication (still an antidepressant) and he is a MUCH nicer man to have dinner with!

  I do have one suggestion.  AARP offers a Mature Drivers Class for anyone over 50. It's 8 hours divided over 2 days about ALL the driving rules, especially the latest rules.  Also there is information about how our aging vision and hearing can affect driving, also when to give up driving, and how to locate alternative transportation.   
  All of the instruction is in-class; there is no driving.  Once the 8 hours are completed, the driver will get a certificate and become eligible for a 5% discount on auto insurance, good for 3 years.   
  It might be a good idea for all adult childen to suggest this to their parents, whether or not they notice changes.  Members and non-members of AARP can attend.  The adult child and parent could discuss the new rules and anything the child thinks is pertinent.  If there is any questionable area, the adult child will have some objective ammunition to begin a serious driving discussion.

--eat the Mediterranean diet, including many anti-oxidant foods and omega 3 fats. 
--exercise vigorously to tolerance 
--continue to stimulate the brain with new learning 
--continue socialization 
  Also, get plenty of restful, deep sleep.  Avoid stress.  Many patients engage in complementary treatments, such as aromatherapy or light therapy.

She has always had a sweet tooth and when she was still living at home I would get so upset because we would have ice cream bars in the freezer, and she would sneak and eat sometimes three in a day ! somewhere between breakfast and dinner time .  !  I would tell my father to stop buying the junk at the store because I felt so much sugar and acidity(milk) is so bad for your body and mind.  My dad almost always had a dessert for them after dinner too!  If he put the dessert on the table with the meal my mom would refuse to eat the meal and just wanted the dessert.
Now that she is no longer at home, I worry she is not getting enough food with how much weight she has lost.   Back up fat reserves and nutrition is important if a LO happens to get sick.
I think many of the suggestions above are wonderful. 
I fall somewhere in the middle of making sure your LO is getting as close to possible a healthy nutritious diet to maintain weight and still let  them eat sugary snacks .

1829.6,"Hello Blazemom and a very warm welcome to you.   I am sorry for what is happening and can certainly understand your concern.  Your parents are blessed to have such a caring daughter.
Hopefully your father has had a thorough medical exam with a full menu of labs drawn to check body systems that may be all of or part of the causation for his changes.   Chem panel, B12, thyroid check, CBC, UA and more; all would be part of a good screen.
Since the changes in your father began with the radiation therapy for lung cancer, one can wonder what the possible relationship of that may be.  While our primary care MDs are awesome at so much, they are not on the cutting edge of dementia nor are the specialists who practice areas other than dementia.
It would be a positive to have your father seen by a good Neurologist who sees dementia patiens as a routine part of his/her practice.  Neuro will be able to assess the possible effects of cumulative radiation and medications on the brain and will also be able to determine if and what type of dementia is present.   This is important as there are multiple different types of dementia and even different causations.  Meds for one type of dementia may be contraindicated in another and even make things worse.  Neuro is best at making an accurate diagnosis for type of dementia.
Once you know what is present, then a plan of care can be developed. In some instances there are medications that can slow down memory loss and can also meet other challenges.
NOTE:  Though it may sound unnecessary; you absolutely, positively DO need to have your parents do their ""estate planning,"" and have Durable Powers of Attorney done; one for Healthcare, the other for Finance for each parent.  These are a safeguard should a Loved One, (LO) have a sudden change in condition and are no longer able to make decisions for themselves and need someone to assist them.
This would not be a threat to your mother; it is a protection.  It is best to do this through an Elder Law Attorney as that is the specialty that is needed. The Certified Elder Law Attorney can also help plan and position your parents best for future needs to protect them and their assets.  This is very important.
For my LOs who were elderly and who may have questioned my being a ""Power"" of Attorney; I simply decided to say that we needed to do, ""Estate Planning,"" and that was acceptable.
If you do not do this, if something unforeseen happens to your mother, there will be no legal documents outlining if someone can make decisions, who is in charge of making decisions and how that is to be done, who is the one chosen to represent the parent(s), etc. ALSO:  The parent has to be able to sign the document. One can have dementia and still be able to sign as long as the person knows that it is a document to protect them and to whom they are making their power of attorney.
I would not delay the legal aspect as well as the medical aspect; you will be glad you did. It is even very helpful if the parent trusts the adult child to have ones name put on checking and savings.  This helped me to avoid SO much complexity, delays and other problems with the banks.
The Alzheimer's Assn. Helpline can be reached at:  (800) 272-3900.  If you call, ask to be transferred to a, Care Consultant.  There are no fees for this service. Consultants are highly educated Social Workers who specialize in dementia and family dynamics. They are very supportive, have much information and can often assist us with our problem solving.

15318.3,"Welcome, Sancheza. I cannot give a direct answer to your question, but there are limitations to both Aricept and Cerefolin NAC. Aricept inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine (which is critical for short-term memory). It treats an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease, so for awhile some people appear to be doing better with the drug. But as the disease progresses the problem becomes the transport of choline and the production of acetylcholine. In most people with Alzheimer's disease, Aricept helps for a relatively short period of time if at all.

B12 in Cerfolin may be of some small benefit as an antioxidant. Folate (another ingredient in Cerefolin) had not helped so far in clinical trials. Another compound in Cerefolin--N-acetylcysteine--is very important because it is one of the building blocks for glutathione which protects the brain from damage. But the problem again is that the cysteine transport system is damaged in the Alzheimer's brain.

Glutathione is controversial because some people say it can enter brain cells and others say it cannot. If it could, it would be a very helpful compound in treating Alzheimer's disease.

http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2015/04/17/can-drinking-milk-prevent-alzheimers-disease (dietary strategies may have limited effects when it comes to increasing glutathione levels and current supplements may not be of much help either).

The right antioxidants may help treat Alzheimer's disease (although some stimulants can also increase anxiety).

Many members complain that their LO is in denial, and that makes the member upset or even angry, because they liken it to denial about being an alcoholic.

I want them to understand that anosognosia is a real condition, and that it is due to brain disease, not to conscious or subconscious avoidance for psychologic reasons.

Anosognosia is also a feature of other neurologic conditions, such as brain trauma or stroke.

The more family members understand about AD and dementia, the more they can help us patients.

24889.7,"Jen, you have a way with words.  You remind me of another caregiver member who I suggested that she have a career in comedy writing.  She told me she already did stand-up.  I still don't know why she's not a professional comedienne.

In your case, your writing is pithy and nuanced.  What are you doing with this gift?  My personal suggestion is that you do something to promote dementia awareness and care for the dementia patient. 

There are over five million dementia patients in the US.  This does not include MCI/CI patients.  Each patient is connected to three caregivers, according to AA statistics.  That means there are over fifteen million caregivers in the US.  Only a few hundred or a few thousand are members of this board.  Where are the others?   How will they learn what to do to address their ADLOs needs?

As you can see from reading the posts, most caregivers have absolutely no knowledge of what to do before they become picked by the fickle finger of fate to become a dementia caregiver.

You could write a book or a blog to help these others.  Your style of writing is very entertaining.  You are learning through the school of hard knocks what to do for the dementia patient.



You are a self-described logical person.  What the other members have learned is that they have to suspend their own beliefs, and enter into the irrational reality of their dementia LO.  They learn to speak ""Alzheimer's"", so to speak.  Everything you learned about communication, especially communication with a LO, you have to change to a new way of communicating.    Wow.

The LO may seem more or less normal in outside appearances, but you can observe that the behaviors are not normal.

To tell you the truth, I really don't see where you are going with your new method of communication.  It appears to be a type of ""tough love,"" am I right?  Tough love works on consequences.  Dementia patients lose the ability to understand consequences, due to impairment of executive functions. 

You are right that scammers take advantage of seniors and people with dementia.  I call them vultures.  They prey on the vulnerable.  Part of the job of a caregiver is to protect the vulnerable person from these vultures.  They come in the form of family members, long lost friends, and over the telephone and internet and in the mail.  Vultures are everywhere!  They sometimes come bearing gifts to soften up the victim.

9379.2,"My parents, especially my father before he passed away, were very stubborn about moving to an AL facility or receiving any help from home health, etc.  In fact, after convincing them to accept home health a few times a week, they canceled the home health and told them not to come back because ""they aren't sick"".    We saw how they were declining in their functioning and it was concerning.  We did what we could, but we did not live close to them and it was hard.  I talked to a counselor about this.  The counselor's advice was to continue to do the best I could, but you can't always force them to change their minds, even if we know they are making poor decisions.   It's still their decision and it hurts us, but we have to just let it be sometimes.  The counselor said that generation in general is stubborn about receiving help or moving.  In my opinion, they are probably stubborn because they are envisioning AL facilities as they were long ago, not realizing how far AL and MC have come.  Finally, finally after I had a crying episode in front of my father, he agreed to just tour an AL facility.  It was then that he saw how nice it was.
Good luck, it's not easy and I've been there.  Take care of yourself, do the best you can, but sometimes you have to just let it be.   Would a trusted doctor or friend be able to talk to your dad?

In fact, with our home care, he was eating more than he had in years.  But still the weight came off.  While I know she's walking a lot, there is some of this that is just the disease process itself.  
   As Gemswinner mentioned, this seems to bother you more than it does her.  I'd bring in treats, and make certain she's getting things she really likes, beyond that I'd leave it alone.

7722.2,"Welcome. So sorry to hear this. You have a lot to manage here.
In terms of your FIL, there are a lot of good resources in this site that you could print out for him to read. What might be more effective is to hear from a medical professional, who can discuss your mother's condition, needs, and prognosis. It is also possible that your FIL has some well-disguised cognitive decline and his denial is actually anosognosia, the inability of the damaged brain to recognize that something is wrong.
Your FIL cannot do this alone, and the lifestyle of roaming around in a motor home is no longer suitable for a person with advanced dementia who is nonambulatory. We use a Hoyer lift for my mother, who is completely nonambulatory. It requires patience and planning. If the person in the sling gets frightened or freaks out, serious injury can occur. Not to mention, your MIL needs consistent medical care and home services.
If your MIL is Stage 6, it is unlikely that dementia drugs like Aricept will do much to slow the disease, although some people think otherwise. There are also medications that can help with pain and agitation, but a relationship with a medical provider is needed, preferably a neurologist with experience in caring for dementia patients. Has she actually been diagnosed?
If the incontinence is a new phenomenon, you might want to rule out urinary tract infection or some other underlying problem. In terms of her not wanting to wear Depends, you need to get rid of all of her other underwear. Make sure the Depends are the right size so that they are comfortable. If it helps, make up a little white lie, such as that they are free to senior citizens.
If your inlaws have no assets or savings, they may be eligible for Medicaid. With Medicare, the costs of home health are largely paid by the individual, except for short-term services. Medicaid may pay for home health aides and other services in the home if there are qualifying diagnoses. Without much in the way of assets, the options for assisted living may be limited. I would suggest talking to a geriatric care manager and an elder law attorney. ",1,1

Good idea you have to move all stuff when she is otherwise engaged with a ""friend"" who is visiting; you have capably got it covered.  Please take good care of you too and try not to overdo; why not hire someone to do the heavy lifting and hauling.  
Reading your Posts brings back strong memories of when I was doing the same thing; logic told me that it was absolutely the right decision, (and it really was), but my heart was feeling the grief of it all, my brain was throwing out moments of stark guilt, and then there were those moments of second guessing myself, all on top of the running about to get it all together as very best as could be, at least I hoped so.  Seems for many of us, this is part of the process.  If we were not caring and loving people, it wouldn't make a dent in our feelings; but we do care, so we get all the bits and pieces that spring to the surface in such a situation.
Oh boy; on admission day, I was a bundle of quivers and quakes; frankly, for a strong person, I was a bit (more than a bit) of an internal mess, though the outside kept smiling for the sake of my LO.  I imagined all sorts of dreadful possibilities that could happen; the worst imagining being the possibility of an overwhelming epic meltdown of my LO.   I feared what may happen, and of course, my imagination was far worse than the reality.  In fact, everything went far more smoothly than I could have imagined.
The staff of the facility were marvelous.  They had asked in advance what my LOs favorite snack or food was; it was a fruit plate with cottage cheese.   When we arrived, the room was cozy; I had everything in place and it was actually nice.   The administrator, social worker  and an aide came to the room to great us.   They did not overdo, it was just a nice, soft, social greeting.   When we were settled in, suddenly, a fruit plate with cottage cheese appeared and was greatly appreciated by my LO who was smiling big smiles.
I exited stage left quietly as the aide assigned to my LO stayed and engaged in soft conversation.   All was well . . . . except there I was at 2:00 am, eyes wide open looking into the dark and wondering how my LO was doing.   So, I got up and made a phone call and found that all was well and my LO was peacefully sleeping and all had gone smoothly the entire afternoon and evening.   Talk about grateful.
Guess the most important thing is to remember that it quite often does take tincture of time for adaptation, and also that there is most often no perfection in all of this; there is only the very best that one can do under the circumstances; and you are already off to a really, really good start.

46345.1," Sad lucy, here is a copy of advice given to another member dealing with an anger situation.  The main points are to tell someone and to keep yourself safe.
Ask his doctor about medications.  Be aware that some medications can provoke anger and aggression.

If you are in a crisis situation, call 911 and ask for the geriatric psychiatric crisis team to take him in for assessment.



 Here is the advice:
  When those we live with progress in their dementia to the point of getting physically violent, the situation has reached a crisis, and crisis intervention is called for. The suggestions that are included in this thread are correct – the way to intervene is to get professionals involved. Please understand that hoping that things will change does not provide adequate protection for anyone in this situation. It is your job as caregiver to protect the person with dementia and yourself by getting a plan in place immediately for how to intervene both now and when the person becomes actively aggressive.

a. For now:
i. Have a fully charged cell phone with you at all times.
ii. Be sure that all weapons or potential weapons are removed from the home.
iii. Let others know about what the situation is – friends, family, clergy, professionals, the Alzheimer’s Association’s Helpline (1-800-272-3900).
iv. Speak with the person’s physician about medications to help with these behavior issues.
v. Have a safe place within the house and outside of the house to go to if necessary. Make sure that these locations have the ability to be locked.
vi. Follow up with a geriatric neurologist familiar with dementia.
vii. Research geriatric psychiatric facilities in your area and speak with staff there about how to arrange for admission if need be.

b. For when the person is actively aggressive:
i. Remove yourself from the situation as quickly and calmly as possible.
ii. Get to a safe place behind locked doors.
iii. Call 911 immediately. Tell the dispatcher that the person has a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and is being aggressive. Describe what is going on, and let them know if there are any weapons in the home that you are aware of (if not already removed).
iv. Remain behind locked doors until help arrives and signals that you are safe to come out.
v. Request that the authorities on site transfer the person to a geriatric psychiatric facility for an emergency assessment.
vi. Follow up medically with the person’s physician(s).
vii. Convene a family meeting to discuss the situation.
viii. Follow up on plans for placement into a facility in which multiple people are prepared to handle the person’s aggressiveness as a team.

It is terribly frightening to be confronted with this type of aggression and to have to make such heart-wrenching decisions. Please know that the professionals at the Alzheimer’s Association’s 24/7 Helpline at 1-800-272-3900 is available to talk about your situation day or night, and can help with resources and getting assistance when needed. Please call and have a discussion with a Care Consultant. They are knowledgeable, compassionate and can help you prepare now in order to avoid having an already dangerous situation escalate into a crisis.

Welcome to the boards. I'm praying that your husband has something fixable, like low B12, low thyroid, etc.

You hubby sounds just like mine three years ago, except for the getting lost. DH (dear husband) still knows his way around our town and the city where he grew up. He can't navigate around new places anymore. Neither can I, so I bought a Garmin.

Your hubby will need thorough medical testing to rule out those fixable things. An MRI can look for things like stroke or tumor. Finally, he will need neuropsychological testing which can pin down the diagnosis further.

Your comment, ""When I talk to him about it, he gets very defensive, says I'm the one who's playing games with him."" sounds very familiar too. DH still tells me that there is nothing wrong with him, I am making it all up, etc. This sounds like denial. But, in fact, it is usually a condition called anosognosia, in which a patient with a brain disease is unable to recognize the fact that he has a disease. Literally, it means ""lack of self-awareness"". About 80% of patients with dementia have this. You can never talk them out of this. You can't reason with them about it. If your husband seems to have this, save yourself the stress of trying to convince him otherwise.

Also, whether your husband has dementia or not, it is good to get your affairs in order. Make sure your wills or trusts are up to date. Make certain that you have powers of attorney for finances and for healthcare. Make sure that your hubby isn't YOUR power of attorney. That won't work too well if he has a cognitive disorder. Find someone else close to you who can do that for you.

And don't stop posting here. You will have more questions, and we have answers. Not me, personally, but someone else on here will likely have had that same question and they now know the answer.",1,1

Try imagining yourself in your father's place - with some confusion and some memory loss. Think about how embarrassed you would be if someone complained about YOU pooping on the floor. No matter how diplomatic you try to be, that is what it is going to sound like to him.
Can you make it a little easier for him by putting out flushable wipes? And perhaps put an extra trash container next to the toilet? Don't expect things to be perfect. People at his stage of dementia have problems with sequencing tasks. So he may get up from the toilet, pull his pants up and forget why he was there. Or, he may know he needs to attend to his personal care after a BM, but forget how to get started.
This is all happening because his dementia causes death of brain cells and some of his abilities are being short circuited. However, whatever cognition or memory is still there, knows he ""should not have done that"" and he is embarrassed even though it really is not his fault.
He will forget about this episode soon and if it happens again, he won't know what you are talking about if you mention that you already told him to clean up after himself.
Try the wipes, but you might also work on encouraging him to have a BM first thing in the morning. Ask your doctor if you can use a mild laxative in the evening to encourage this. If he can get on a schedule, you can check the Bathroom right after he is done each morning and then there should not be many more surprises.

I haven't had to deal a lot with the financial aspect just yet, but I know there are members here who can be a wealth of information. I also know you can call the 24 hour help line, and get resources for all sorts of things.
My question for you, is can you hire a caregiver (or 2) to come care for your mom in your home while you figure things out? I'm guessing you aren't needing 24 hour care yet, so costs would not compare to the cost of placing her into a MC facility.
Also, don't forget to do things to take care of you and relieve stress. The weekend away is great; how about once a week date nights? Or something as simple as a hot bath with a good book and a glass of wine after everyone is asleep? I have even been known to park at a park and ride to read for 20 minutes alone when I am running errands. Basically anything you can do to recharge for yourself. A career, husband, baby, and EO mom is way too much to handle with out breaks.

You said in another thread, IIRC, you accept that sedation can be given, even if unwanted, to protect them against themselves. Is this so different?
If she does go, or is, sepsis, you know you may not have days to think about it. You could well be down to hours. Are you prepared to live with the consequences, how your future will be affected, if she died because of this?

DH  does not do well with any change of routine, so we just stay home. It is easier for both of us. I had to quit a job I loved in Jan. 2015 to become a fulltime caregiver.

What would you do if there was a fire in the house? What would you do if a water line broke and started flooding? What would you do if you fell and hurt yourself? In each case, he told me that he would wait for me to get home. He had a caregiver within weeks for the times I had to go out. 

He has long-term care insurance. In order to approve the claim, a nurse came out to evaluate him. Like your wife, his ADLs were intact. But then she asked him her own series of ""What if..."" questions. For each example, he told her that he would tell Elaine. She asked him how he would tell me - would he roll over in bed to tell me? Would he go to another room to tell to me? Would he call me on the phone? He just repeated that he would tell Elaine. He hasn't been alone since. ",0,1

She had to be admitted to a skilled nursing facility after having intestinal bleeding issues, but also auditory and visual hallucinations and sundowning, all in a very short span of time with home health care, and a prior diagnosis of MCI that previous fall. She was tested at length for any underlying infections, of which she had none. She was extremely combative and delusional in the skilled nursing facility, refused to eat because people were trying to ""poison her."" Refused her necessary meds for her high blood pressure, and would not cooperate with any of the staff. Her diagnosing physician finally decided that she needed a psychotropic medication to stop the 24/7 paranoia and hallucinations, or she wouldn't survive. He put her on Risperdal, after extensive discussions about it with us. It was a difficult decision, since it is a potent drug with several serious side effects, and takes at least a month to kick in. Amazingly, she started responding to it within a week--she was still very sick, but finally had calmed down enough to take her other necessary meds, and eating a little. This doctor saved her life (along with telling us that she was in mid to late stage dementia, most likely vascular, and Lewy-Body). We had no idea, but saw that she was getting to the point that home health care was no longer an option for her. We were told that she could not live alone any longer, and needed skilled nursing and a memory care facility. We were able to get her transferred to a MC home near us, and after a month on Risperdal, she finally ceased having the extreme paranoia and hallucinations. She is still maintaining on this drug, and it has given her another chance at some quality of life. Talk to your doctors; my MIL is lucky, because some psychotropics can have dire side effects for Lewy-Body dementia. She has had none.

  Start each appointment by looking directly at your patient's face and greeting him or her warmly by name.  Then ask how he or she is feeling, and WAIT for an answer in a calm and silent manner.  Inquire about changes in the patient's lifestyle, and listen attentively to the answer.  During examinations or discussions, give your patients positive feedback with smiles, nods, and phrases like, ""Yes, I understand"" and ""Very good, Ellen.""  Tell your patients in very simple terms what you want them to do, avoiding medical jargon and long sentences.  ASK your patients if they understand and agree with your treatment plans.  Give your patients all your instructions and advice in writing, and invite them to call with follow up questions.  Welcome family members' presence and ask for their observations.  Remember that you are not treating an illness;  you are treating a PERSON.

Today is turning out better then yesterday when Gerry got up about 4 AM - Diego and Oscar heard him and went to  check it out so I got up too. Gerry was standing in  the bathroom with his partial beside the side - likely was planning to shave and brush his  teeth to prepare for the day ~ not that he does either anymore. I  talked him back to bed but the pups, of course, had to go outside and when they came him they were ready to play, So there I was sitting on my bed shortly after  4 watching them play ! too early in the day but so sweet.  
We got a thunder storm and rain so I cancelled  the swim I planned for when  Khalsa came to care for Gerry. Instead , I decided to go in my  room. close the door and have a siesta.  I closed my eyes and was gone for two hours. What I wouldn't give to be  able to do that more often.  I need to  tell Khalsa to give Gerry his lunch around noon - 1 PM and she was just making a sandwich.  Since he doesn't eat breakfast I think that is too late.  
Today I had arranged for  Ariana to help me take Diego, Oscar and Lucy to the vet. The boys for another shot an Lucy to check of growth on her shoulder.  Her baby-sitter cancelled an hour before she was due  here so I was on my own with  Gerry going to the vet ~ decided to leave Lucy at home and just talk to him about the growth - he suggested I just keep an eye on it and let him know if it grows.  The boys on the other hand are getting a little pudgy so I need to feed them  a little less or only twice a day.  They are such rascals and get into whatever they can find but I  do adore them and love  to see Lucy and Ginger accept them now - they even seemed  worried when I took the  boys  to the vet and crowded them to  check them out when we got home.
Gerry is on a  brownie a day  routine now and paces a talks nonsense a little less - on a difficult day I just give him another and he calms down.  I find myself much less stressed so he is less  stressed so I am less stressed so he is less stressed  and on and on.  Such a  simple solution  and a gentle way to help him and myself at the same time.
Ellen. How horrible  to have bomb and shooting threats in your town.  Hopefully the police will track  down the morons and deal with them swiftly.  What a crazy world we live in.
Joan. How nice  to have a surprise visit  with your daughter  and for Harv to have a good day when she saw him is wonderful.  I wonder how Gerry's daughter  will manage when  she visits next winter.
Diane I am delighted for you that you are enjoying time with your gentleman friend ~ meeting him away from home for now is a great idea.
Lorita I hope you are having a good day - this thread is just not the  same without a post from you.

I really must be in the acceptance stage of how he is now ~ I am actually chuckling at all the  things he is  doing and saying even though none of it makes  sense to me. Bless his sweet heart and the confusion  going on inside his head.

  When one of our paid caregivers went on vacation--that confirmed to me that the number of caregivers we have is okay--mom likes the different interactions (and will prepare her for a NH when we do respite care), and we have back-ups.  Most of our ladies come from the same nursing home in their regular jobs, so they sometimes will cover each other and then tell me the change -- I then update the schedule that hangs on Mom's door (once in a while I print off a copy for Mom so she can go over who will be with her for the afternoon/early evening)..

  I would, and did with my mother, do those things under the radar. It was a gradual takeover, done under cover, and sometimes you have to be creative.
Mom is a big-time hoarder.

My husband has always been his own boss and definitely does not like being told what he must do and it is so hard for me because I have never wanted to ""boss"" him!  He is 87 and in excellent health for someone that age, except for the Alzheimer's, which appears to be moving more into the severe stage.  He thinks there are two of me taking care of him and is often very restless and agitated at night, which means neither of us gets sleep.  I have sent an update of his condition to his Neurologist since there is never enough time during a follow up visit to go into all of it.  We see him again in a  couple of weeks and I hope he can prescribe something to help.  My husband has been taking Aricept and Namenda for almost 4 years and those drugs did help for about three years.",0,1

43473.2,"Cyclist13,  My DH has always been a walker.  So have I.  We have hiked many a mile together and had hoped to hike the Appalachian Trail in our retirement.
  At this point, my husb is in the later stages of alz.  He can't bathe himself, dress himself, or feed himself.  But he can still walk.  And it is important to him to do this.  All day long.
  Earlier in the disease process we would walk a mile or so several times a day.  As he declined, it eventually turned into walks around the block.  And now we walk back and forth in front of the house.   
  Walking helps him release some of the anxiety that has built up.  It helps him stay more limber.  It helps him keep his sense of balance - falls are a huge risk factor in the later stages.  And yes, it is aggravating to me to have him ask all day long for another walk (he doesn't remember a single one of them for more than a minute or two).  But I try to accommodate him as much as I can. 
  As you can see, I am an advocate for allowing the walks, within reason of course.  And absolutely someone should go with him.  That way you can make sure he is safe.   And if he gets out for a few walks when he would like to, perhaps he will be more inclined to return to the house.  Knowing there will be another walk later.  And if you can outlast him and allow him to wear himself out a bit, that might help too. 
  A couple of important matters:
     He is a very likely candidate to wander, so you will need to be extra vigilant about his safety.  There are devices, - GPS, medic alert, ... - that will help facilitate his return if he does get lost.  
     Extra locks on all doors leading outside are important so that he doesn't leave without someone being aware of it.  Put them up high or somewhere he isn't accustomed to as he will be much less likely to find them.  And his attempts to get out the door will probably be heard by anyone in the house, alerting you to his trying to go outdoors. 
     If he hasn't already tried to do so, he may start to wander at night.  This is especially dangerous.  Thus, the extra locks and such.
     I also put baby gates across our stairwells (to prevent falls).  As one stairwell leads to the back door, it has also served to prevent his going outside  without me.  Before the extra locks and gates, I did have to chase him down the street a few times.  Entertainment for the neighbors!!

19946.3,"Hi Tarzy-
There's no one size fits all answer to this question.  A lot depends on the Stage your Dad is at, it will also depend on how he reacts to change in general.
A few things to consider:
-is Dad likely to start asking to come home if he comes for a visit?
-how does he deal with social situations?  Does he enjoy them?
-how disoriented and anxious is he with changes in routine and scenery?
-is someone in the family willing to sacrifice their visiting with Dad to become the eagle eyed caregiver for the day?
  It is pretty early in AL to be looking for a well adjusted Dad to come out for a visit.  However, if he is very mellow, it's not impossible.  Each holiday, I see a number of residents wheeled out for dinners with their children at a relatives home.  My father, however, cannot deal with changes in environment or schedule, and therefore, he has never come out of his facility for such an event.
  Also think about this:  would Dad really miss and or/enjoy such a dinner, or is it the family's issue because they think Dad should be there?  For years, my brother badgered me to take Dad to  my home for the holidays, but that fit only my brother's idea of what was right, it was not a realistic idea of what is good for Dad.",0,1

    Irisized, after giving this some thought, I have to agree that you do have some points.  My field was  pediatrics.  I have come to discover that pediatrics is nothing like adult medicine.  I have been sorely disappointed in the care given by my adult medicine colleagues, both to myself and to my fellow members on this board.  What I read is shocking, and not at all how I was trained, nor how I practiced.  


To tell you the truth, I'm kind of soured on my own profession, too, and I feel very bad about that.  Nevertheless, there are still some good doctors.  I had a good geriatrician at a university medical center, but he left after some changes at the medical center.  Another geriatrician at another facility also left unexpectedly.  I know that they did not leave abruptly because their care was poor.    I believe they were forced out.  (That's my opinion.)  Right now, I have a very good neurologist.


Yes, we do have to be advocates for ourselves and for our ADLOs.  The poor care for PWDs is very upsetting.  The only thing I can think of to do is for patients and caregivers to educate ourselves, like we are doing, and to challenge the doctors and other professionals for better care.

18859.7,"Supeters29, I felt the same way when I had to move my mom to memory care. At the time, I thought she was more with it than a lot of the other residents (and maybe she was....maybe not.) I think it actually was good for Mom to be ""higher functioning"" than some of the others. It made her feel good about herself. And, my mom was always a caregiver--for her grandfather for her husband, for her 5 kids--so she settled into a sort of caregiving role at her facility.

As the disease has progressed, Mom is now one of the lesser functioning residents. Her walking is not good, she has become more upset and belligerent, demanding to see her parents and my dad. The aides at the facility know how to deal with this, and they are absolute godsends. 

I have said this before, and I do think it's VERY true. You need to place your mom based on how she behaves on her WORST days, not her BEST days. Facilities that offer a high level of care can scale it back for a healthier, higher functioning resident, but a facility that does not offer enough care can't really ""ramp up"" to meet the needs of someone who's beyond their scope.

I think only a small minority of patients or caregivers become angry and abusive. But everyone has bad days. In my husband's case, he became angry from the beginning which was out of character for him. When coupled with memory loss, it was the reason I contacted his doctor. During this early period, he became violent a couple of times stopping just short of hitting me. I was frightened, but rationalized it was the disease causing it. He began to take meds that helped, but the anger at me was still there. As the years went by, he began hitting my arms when I helped him with dressing, diaper changes, feeding. He was weaker and it didn't particularly hurt, but did leave bruises. It just became my life, I didn't really think about. In October, 2014, I had a break down at Bob's neurologist office. I don't know why, but I showed the doctor the bruises. He immediately prescribed anti-psychotic drugs. But Bob had a heart attack the next day, was in the hospital, and was doing poorly. His doctor wouldn't allow him to come home, and our children insisted he be placed in a memory care facility. He's now aspirating into his lungs and had two bouts of pneumonia, he's in hospice. He doesn't know any of us, isn't aware of his condition or his surroundings, but he still has periods of anger which are mostly kept in check with meds.

I married him 37 years ago because he was such a good person, he was extraordinarily patient, a gentleman in every sense of the word. He is adored and admired by all his children.

I was pleased to read about all that you did.   I am a collector of Music, I would love to know what your ""wedding song was""?    Also HAPPY ANNIVERSAY!
ALL THE best to you both...

My hubs has one foot in stage 6 and one foot in stage 7.
  It's funny about friends. We always counted ourselves lucky because we had so my friends. Clearly...We were wrong. We have 2 couples that check in with us and offer moral support.

24521.15,"A crisis of any kind, which AD is, can test ones ""mettle.""  
Our family members, whether distant or close, are displaying how they behave in crisis and for many of us, its not pretty.  In fact, seeing how they respond/or fail to respond can be heartbreaking and disappointing.  In my case, as in many others, I would have never thought that my sister would never talk to my mom again.  I had an entirely different image of my sister and her husband.  Now I know what they are capable of.  A rude surprising awakening.  
In my opinion most of our relatives are not going to change...this is how they respond to difficulties.  Unless they receive intense therapy it is my view that they will not change, this is part of their personality make up or at least an aspect of their personality.  A significant number of medical insurance companies, as an example, will not cover therapy sessions for individuals diagnosed with personality disorders because it is virtually impossible to change/alter personality.
My experience has taught me many things one of which is I would never pick my sister or her husband as friends.  Never.
I forgive my sister for me an irrational person that jumps to conclusions; (I guess that is quasi foregiveness).  Remembering what she has done ensures that I will never be hurt by her again.  
I never knew my sister was capable of doing what she has done...i never imagined her to be the way that she is.  I have to say, I was in a state of disbelief for a long time.  My experience coupled with the problems I see on this forum, I have come to realize that my case is not unique.

14389.1,"Larry, I read what you wrote about loneliness, and that's true.  But I think there's a difference between being alone and being lonely.  I like to be alone sometimes, but there are times I hate being alone; those are the times I feel lonely.  Those times are forced on me by this damned disease; they're not my choices.  Mostly I miss having the woman I married around so we could talk about our day; our joys or our sorrows.  I used to walk by her and pat her on the butt, or she'd walk by me and muss my hair.  Missing that sort of thing is what leads me to feeling lonely.  I still hate setting the dinner table for one; that always leads me to feeling lonely. 
  The thing I do to get out of that bottomless feeling of abandonment is to count my blessings. I believe God loves my wife and me, and all of us, and cares  even more than I do.  I believe God goes through all this pain right along with me.   An attitude of gratitude is a good tool to get me out of my self-pity and loneliness. I don't have a TV, so I listen to music a lot during the day.  I also make it a point to talk with a few neighbors every day; isolation always leads me downhill.

35075.4,"This really is a huge challenge that has no easy answers and I can only imagine how stressed and worried you must be.   I am sorry this is happening and that there is so much confusion about what is actually going on.
I forgot to ask what insurance coverage your mother has.  It would be good to know that as our replies can take that into consideration.
Thinking about this, even if this were happening with my mother, I would not take her home.  The 24/7 care needs are of extremely high acuity, require highly skilled attention and lots and lots of 24 hour complex care.  I would try to use Skilled Care first, and then transfer to long term care. This is usually at the same facility as Skilled Care is done on special units in nursing home facilities and after Skilled Care is complete, the patient is simply moved to a new room for long term care with aides and RNs.
Your mother would receive a higher level of care with the services at a care facility with 24 hour aide assistance as well as 24 hour availability of licensed nurses as well as RNs who perform the necessary wound treatments, tube feedings and oversight assessment.
This also lets you get the rest you need so you do not become ill from severe stress; you can be with your mother as much as you wish without being overwhelmingly tired and can be the loving daughter you always have been without the uber-stress.  This would not be abandoning your mother; you would still be her advocate and providing her care in a bit of a different way.  The decision is up to you to do what is best for her; the doctors, RNs, and Discharge Planners can discuss this with you at the hospital.
Sometimes Parkinson's symptoms wax and wane when on L-Dopa; if the physcian specialists truly feel she does not have Parkinson's Disease, then the Neurologist should see her while she is still in the hospital and help to discern just what condition she actually has that as causing the problems.  There are conditions that can mimic Parkinson's.
NOTE:  What is also concerning is your mother's difficulty in ability to swallow.  Has a physician ordered a Swallow Evaluation for her if he/she feels it is safe to do so?  If the MD feels that the swallow mechanism is so compromised, the MD may feel any swallow of liquid or food may be dangerous and therefore will not order the exam.
If it is safe to do so, this test is easy; nothing touches the patient.  It is done by a Speech Therapist, and is most often done with video-fluoroscopy in the x-ray department.  The person simply sits on a guerney with the fluoroscope in front of them. The Speech Therapist then gives the person a small amount of liquid; then perhaps a tiny bit of applesauce or pudding, and if tolerated, then perhaps a bit of cracker.
The therapist can watch in real time as the flouroscope will show the inside of the mouth, the tongue, the swallow all the way down.  This way, the therapist is able to diagnose just what the problem issue is and then a plan of care developed. 
Sometimes, for some patients, swallow is really compromised and by drinking or eating even pureed foods or thickened liquids, can still aspirate the substance into their lungs which causes pneumonia.   This can be deadly.
Some aspiration is easy to spot as the patient coughs and chokes; BUT some aspiration is ""silent aspiration,"" where there is no coughing or choking, but the food still is aspirated into the lungs with the risks of eventual pneumonia that presents.
SO . . . . please do not feed unless the physician has told you it is safe to do so and writes an order that this can be done and the type of foods/fluids prescribed. Right now, with the tube feedings, your mother is getting more nutrition than could be got into her with oral feedings with the problem issues that are present in her ability to swallow.
As for the ""plastic mattress.""  That sounds as though it is an alternating air pressure mattress and that is a VERY good thing.  That will do the best at protecting your mother as best can from developing further skin breakdown and ""bedsores,"" and help the body to heal sores or breakdown that already exists.  If your mother is transferred to a care facility for Skilled Care and/or long term care, or even to home, it would be good to have the alternating air pressure mattresss ordered for her by the Discharge Planner or doctor.     
I am sorry for all the confusion that is going on.   Why not pick a doctor that seems helpful and ask that doctor or your mother's primary care MD to sit down with you and explain each single problem issue and what is medically necessary and what the outcomes may be.  Ask too if she does not have Parkinson's, what condition does she actually have that has been mimicing Parkinsons's.  Sometimes it can be from some types of meds, other times it can be physiological.  You deserve an explanation that gives you better, factual understanding.
THEN . . .  ask a hospital RN to sit down with you and explain each and every  diagnosis and problem issue just as you did with the doctor.  This will give you points of view from both the physician and professional nurse and be very helpful in understanding.  It would be good to take notes.
This has been a very difficult journey for you and it is likely to continue to be so or even become more difficult; having the 24 hour professional level of care with aides and RNs will probably serve both your mother and yourself best.  She is very ill and at very high risk.   Your mother may also be more comfortable with all that assistance than she would be at home.  It is well worth a try.
Please do keep in touch, we will be thinking of you and we truly do care.  And don't forget that the Helpline is there if you want to talk to someone any time of the night or day.
Best wishes are being sent your way,

Not a day goes by when my mom doesn't ask, ""When are we going to see....(dead mother, father, brother, sister)?"" or ""When are we going to go home?"" Many times she asks these question--several times in one hour. I tell her that her mom went to the store, etc... However, today was good because I redirected her to cut out the Sunday coupons.This comes from anxiety and boredom--at least in my mother's case. She never asks when she is engaged in an activity. Fortunately, she can perform some activities with great gusto and attention to detail. However, most require my supervision. I have become her shadow. Only when she eats is she comfortable doing so alone--she's great at cutting up food! Her coordination is excellent, but the mind is totally gone.
   Sadly, things to do to change the behavior of asking these questions are VERY TAXING to me. Require my constant attention. If I don't redirect her, she paces through the house. Today she got out her winter coat--it's 95 degrees here--and she wanted to hail a taxi to her ""house.""

Case managers from AAA visit every quarter and renew their assessments. When the JFS provided a ""Friendly Visitor"" they came and did an intake servery and assessment.

They sometimes ""hurt so good"", but it keeps my muscles and joints in better alignment.  I used to use a chiropractor often, but not often anymore.  I am a bit sore today, because she really had to get deep in my back and shoulder muscles after I handled all the hay.
Carolyn, What good news that your stent episode went well and you already are feeling better.  It certainly is scary that a person can have a heart attack and not know it is happening.  Good luck with your rehab.
Bonnie,  I am going to try making one of those cakes.  It sounds so good.  We all kind of over look the fact that fire fighters are so much more than their name.  It is always great to support them.
Joan,  How was Harv?  I don't like those really hot days either, and I know that what we have is no where near as bad as it is for those in the humid climates.  Almond Butter is something I hadn't thought about for a long time.  I used to keep it in the house all the time, then had a step granddaughter that is allergic to tree nuts.  She had a terrible reaction just from having her sandwich made on the same counter that I made a almond butter sandwich so I quit having it.
Lorita,  I just can't imagine that heat.  I don't know how you manage to get anything done when it is so hot.  That old hay can be a real problem.  Can you get the local fire people to come out and burn the old stuff as a training excersize?    It kills all the ground underneath where it sits and makes an awful mess.  I always burn any old hay each spring while everything is wet and it won't spread.  But, those big round bales are a lot harder to burn and make a bigger fire than the small square ones I deal with.
I am so glad to be finished with the hay. Now I need to get the yard and garden whipped into shape before I go to Washington.
A friend of mine just got a half GP and half golden retriever puppy.  He is so darn cute, but his feet are huge.  He reminds me of a huge hair ball.  He is mostly white and reminds me of pictures of Stormy. She says he is digging huge holes in her yard and carrying stuff everywhere.
I better get out and do that mowing.  Being Saturday, I will have to go somewhere and have fun later.  My friend Kathy had a booth at the Farmers Market this morning, so she will probably be ready to go out and relax for a bit.   Dale called and went to get some bulls in this morning.  He will be around later for sure.  Oops, there we go again.  It is good to have no more to worry about than that.  To those of you who are still in the trenches and those who aren't yet ready to move on, I commend you.    Life is never easy, but much harder for those under such stress from care giving or from lose.  I love all of you.  
May a little sunshine fall on each of you today.  Laugh heartily, it is so good for the inside of us.  Leanne   ",1,1

According to Fidelity Investments, an estimate of average health care costs for a retired couple throughout retirement comes out to $275,000 (even without factoring in any type of long term care). I'm not critical of what you are doing. Just be aware that you might want to consider not spending your retirement nest egg down to your last dollar for MC. Remember, the caregiver needs to put on the oxygen mask first.

30720.3,"My partner spent an hour or two a day, often longer, making collage note cards at her desk. For a while (sorry, don't remember how long) she needed help getting started. And I did a lot of setup -- went shopping with her for materials, bought supplies and tools for her online, organized her desk area with labeled drawers, etc. 

It made a big difference to her to have her own desk area, a kind of command center. It was positioned so it was her private corner; everything in that area was definitely hers. From her chair, she could see the whole room (which included the kitchen at one end) -- and since we live in basically a one-room cabin, she could also see her desk and her bulletin board and her stuff when she first woke up and was still in bed. This was very encouraging and motivating for her.

Her area also included books, address book (large print on 4x6 cards in a binder), photos, keyboard, games....and kind of expanded to another area where she had magazines and other things of interest.

On days when we didn't have a paid caregiver come in, I could get SOME work done (maybe) on my laptop at the dining table, during SOME periods. Mainly though, when my partner wasn't making cards, either I or the paid caregiver did things with her -- played games, conversed, looked at photos together, etc. We didn't have TV, did sometimes watch a comedy via DVD, but half an hour would be enough.

Exercise can be important. For a while the caregiver took my partner to a chair exercise class in the nearest town. And my partner still got on her treadmill (in a different building) most days. She had a drum set over in that building too.

Really, I can't imagine being able to work AND my partner having enough to do, without the extra help and companionship of a paid or volunteer caregiver. (A friend came to do things with my partner on one afternoon a week, just to help.)

Are there any day centers in your area that might be a good fit with your mother's abilities and interests? If not -- I'd consider hiring an aide or recruiting some volunteers to do things with her -- just so she'll have more satisfying activities. If her income and savings won't stretch to cover it, you may live in one of the states that has a Medicaid-funded program for in-home or day care. And some day centers are income-scaled or covered by grants. ",0,1

So they will put the socks and a package with a kitty ball made from alpaca fiber and catnip in there too for Monty, my brother's girlfriend's cat that is my Dad's buddy now, in the sponsor info package.

Since your mom is on hospice, have you explained that to them? By family are you meaning keeping adults informed of the situation or are you meaning children. Of course you would handle each one differently. Children do not need each detail of what is happening.
Please spend time with your mom. Sit by her side, hold her hand, talk to her, massage her hands, etc. Have soft background music on - that is soothing to everyone. Yes the hospice nurse will be able to give you a better timeline, these things can go very quickly or not. Try to not focus on the end, but rather be with your mom, reassure her you love her. The time might be close - spend time with her.

I don't know the particulars of your situation (profiles do not appear to be working), but do be aware, that with a reverse mortgage you are still responsible for all the insurance, maintenance and property taxes on the property. That the loan must be repaid if one moves or die, including a move into assisted living or a nursing home.

Medicaid allows the spouse to keep their primary residence and it is not considered a countable asset.
So, you can keep the house and a certain amount of assets and your husband can still qualify for Medicaid.
If you do a reverse mortgage, you loose the equity in the house and it all goes for his care. By taking a reverse mortgage, you loose any protection for yourself in the value of the house. Reverse mortgages are also expensive; you have to pay an insurance premium every year and probably over 10% to get one.

Please imagine yourself in mom's place. She has short term memory loss, cognitive problems, is in a place that is not the ""home"" she remembers, and on top of this she is having a hard time hearing.
Before you take her to be assessed for depression (which you still might need to do), take her to the doctor and have him check her ears. Unfortunately, blocked hearing due to large deposits of wax is a problem that is rarely addressed in long term care.
As we age, the wax in our ears gets thicker and the hairs that propel the wax down and out, are stiffer and fewer. So blockages are common. She may simply need her ears cleaned out. If not, I'm not sure mom would be able to use hearing aids, but in any case, the staff should know she is hard of hearing and they should adjust their care plan and the way they communicate with her.
Hearing loss can be stressful even for those without dementia. For her, it will increase her confusion, and may eventually cause some combativeness if she does not understand what her caregivers are saying to her.

        Tonight I ran up against it again. I'm not proud to say that I blew a fuse. She threw very hurtful comments at me. Still, I calmed down and was able to ask her if she wanted something that I knew she would enjoy. No matter how hurtful it is, I can't hold anything against her because it's not her fault. It's the disease.
  I made her smile and laugh and then she apologized and gave me a kiss and a hug. I know that the context of our long relationship has vanished but I still want her affection on a daily basis and I am willing to respond.
  Our lives have changed. We have to learn to make the best of it. It sucks, but we can't let it defeat us.

Anyway, this was one of the hardest things for me to learn and accept and that was...the medical field is there to save.  I began to realize that they (the medical professionals) were not going to ever tell me enough was enough.  Their job is to keep life going.  They are not there to weigh in on the ethical issues.  They did not know the vibrant woman my mom once was.  They did not know that she once traveled all over the world, some trips by herself she was so independent.  They did not know that she taught third grade for 33 years and saved every single class list from every class she had because she treasured every one of her students.  They did not know that she was the family historian and everyone in the family called her for that information.  I knew those things.  I also knew that my mom could no longer balance a checkbook.  The once organized woman couldn't find three years worth of tax documents.  She could not remember whether I was her niece or her only child.  She could not remember that her bra was the first item of clothing to go on her body not the last.  She could no longer remember that a shower cap was not an outside hat.  I had to be the one to know that she would not want to live that way.  When two years ago the cardiologist wanted to put in a pacemaker and he asked her and she gleefully said sure after she had worn a heart monitor for three days and had no memory of it...I had to be the one to say NO, enough is enough.  I expected the medical field to know my mom as I knew her, as the whole community knew her.  They did not .  That's when I had to step as her advocate and be her voice and say my mom doesn't want to live like this.  I had to be the one to make those tough choices and at first I thought someone in the medical field would do it for me.  WRONG!  But I did find that as soon as I opened my mouth and said NO, they backed down.  I had to be the one to suggest hospice after waiting week after week for the medical staff to bring it up. When I finally had to courage to say I WANT HOSPICE...shock of all shocks they all nodded their heads and said they were thinking the same thing!  But I had to find the strength to bring it up.

I was the youngest of four and according to others,  spoiled rotten.  I didn't think spoiled was the right word, just head strong. I enjoyed life, while my three siblings liked to bury theirselves into hobbies. I had my first girlf riend in the fifth grade, was smoking in Jr. High and drinking by high school.
Shreveport and Bossier twin twin cities, separated by the Red River.  I grew up in Shreveport which was a tea totaling quite town at the time while Bossier was called little Las Vegas. 
Both of my parents were hard working, loving parents, who gave us a good home, but also taught us to work for what we wanted. I was peddling peanuts and popcorn at ball games when I was 10 and working at a melon garden and drive in produce by the time I was 14. The melon garden was a favorite place for slices of ice cold watermelons. They had picnic tables in the back and a refrigerated trailer full of cold melons. I worked there every day from 7am till 10 pm in the summer, a few hours after school and weekends. I guess that's why I started going to Bossier nightclubs after closing when I started driving. It was hard to get time off during the summer and Bossier was wide open for anyone with a dollar.  Funny, I brought Lou back to Shreveport,  but the crime got so bad we moved to Bossier for piece and quiet, and now on a half acre right outside of Bossier.  I guess my high school years, Bossier's little Las Vegas and working late is why I preferred older women, all the girls my age had to be home by 11 and I was just getting started. Dont get me wrong, I wasn't a bad kid, never got in trouble and worked hard but played just as hard. 
Both older brothers were off to the service during my high school years, one spending his tour in Italy and the other in Hawaii. Myself, never being out of Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas, decided I wanted to see some of the world. My time was Ft Polk, Ft Gordon, Vietnam and Ft Campbell. Don't remember a lot about Vietnam, but have noticed after getting older a few memories are coming back. 
I'm sure by now your getting bored with my life so I will stop for now. You know, I've always heard opposite attracts and I guess Lou and I are perfect examples. Her as a quiet shy girl and me as the fun loving party guy.
Peanut butter cake is about gone so guess after my coffee, I will make a lemon icebox pie for dessert. I believe salmon patties will be tonight's supper.

I’m sorry your visits are causing so much anxiety and stress for you and your mom. For the first 6 months after moving Mom to MC, we experienced the same behaviors (in our situation, the constant stream of angry phone calls came before moving her to MC; afterwards, she’d simply yell at me during my visits!). I’ve learned to time my visits better (tough to do, given work). As a rule, I avoid late afternoons/evening (sun downing and it’s a particularly busy time for staff, so they aren’t able to distract her as easily). The ideal time for me to visit is the period before lunch. I usually walk her to the dining room and leave afterwards. This has become our goodbye ritual. This restricts my visits to the weekends and occasional weekdays (depending on work schedule), but it works for us.
You may also find that the additional structure in the memory care environment helps with your mom’s anxiety. Mom’s angry calls to me were the result of her anxiety.

So glad he was alright and such a blessing to have good neighbors.
   I sent a brief note around to all my 10 neighbors on our street about 18 months ago with my phone number and the fact he has ALZ .  Even the ones I did not know well were so kind to me.   And they have called too.
  There are a lot of people I go to church with in the several streets connected to the larger neighborhood.   They have called me too.
   He does not wander any more.   That stage 4 and 5 were awful for wandering.
Stage 6 has its other issues, but wandering is not one of them.
So glad again, he is home safe.

  Can't speak for all but we were fortunate in finally getting my Frank into the CT state run veterans nursing facility in Rocky Hill. It was such a blessing. Staff was dedicated and awesome, and I especially remember Gracie the wonderful carer who was with him in the early morning when he went to heaven as well as the other carer's whose names are filed back in my memory bank.  I can't say enough good stuff about that place or the staff at all levels.

Yet, other people I know in the Chicago area really liked one Sunrise in the burbs.  It varies hugely.  Many Aldens I heard people complain about, but one of them people loved.
  I think a few important questions to ask yourself and them are:
  * How long has the longest CNA worked here? (Chains are known for high turnover.)
  *  If the ALF is an international corporation with shareholders expecting to profit off of my loved one, what are they going to do to make their profit margins higher and how could this impact my loved one?
  * If you kept your mom where she is and just spend down her money, are the SNF options you have now worse than the less expensive ALF options you have now.

Has his neurologist talked any about the possibility of Wernicke-Korsakoff's or other alcohol related dementias? My dad has mixed dementia- his neurologist feels the Korsakoff's is primary at this point but that there's definitely some Alzheimer's and possibly FTD running in the background. For dad the Korsakoff's symptoms include the inability to learn new things, poor temperature regulation (he's always freezing), very bad spatial reasoning, apathy, and constant confabulation to make up for the ""holes"" in his long term memory. 

You have my sympathies, dementia is difficult when it comes with the sort of mental and behavioral health issues that drive addiction. Sometimes it's hard to hear the oft quoted ""it's the disease"" mantra when the condition was to some degree self-inflicted. 

It's sound like you are taking the right steps to keep your dad safe. Happy, or even content, may not be obtainable. Medication helped here. An antipsychotic to dial back the anger and get him ""unstuck"" as well as a pair of antidepressants. One of those, Wellbutrin, seems to have helped a bit with his addictive tendencies.

The therapist had extensive experience working with dementia patients.  Mom had previous PT following orthopedic surgeries, she was compliant and I believe enjoyed the sessions with the therapist.  She could not self motivate for any in home (between PT sessions) program and resisted any attempts by caregivers to encourage the in home program even though she is a ready participant in other activities like chair yoga.  Although the therapist wanted to encourage her to use a walker to stand straighter, mom was resistant to using a walker and could not use it properly (it became her toy - she liked to do wheelies with it; her battering ram; and her luggage cart).  The PT sessions for balance did seem to help but did nothing to stop or have any permanent effect on her tendency to take overly aggressive positions with a topple risk (standing on one foot and leaning over or reaching up or bending over, etc.)  It did help with conditioning but did not make and can not be expected to have any long term effect on her stoop or lean.
I'm all for anything that gets mom active especially in ways she might not normally choose.  As long as she is compliant and not resistant to the actual PT sessions, I will continue to authorize them especially after any injury or sickness. While the reconditioning aspect seems effective and balance training had some effect, I don't expect to see any permanent improvement in her posture, gait at this point (as one might see in effective rehab for knee surgery etc).  It would be impossible at this point to teach her to use a cane; and the walker only works (but not really) because she used one while recovering from various ortho surgeries.  There is as someone else noted a positive social effect to the interaction with the therapist. 
If insurance is paying, reputable PTs have to document progress and whether PT is having any/any continuing benefit. How your person will do and what the ultimate benefit will be depends on a lot of factors.

  I appreciate your comments so very much. I became the primary caregiver for my 86 year old Mom who has stage 4 Alzheimer's. I cannot describe in adequate wording the journey it has been. My main source of support has been with my daughter Kimberly who has stepped in to be a caregiver as well. She has been a real trooper who keeps me grounded when I am ""down"". I have sought to educate myself as much as possible and this has been a help as well. All I know is my Mom is precious and beautiful and suffers from a truly terrible disease. She now lives in a Nursing Center where the staff is a wonderful one. I needed that assurance because I battled so much for keeping my Mom in home with me but it became apparent and realistic that I was ""hitting the wall"" even with all the resources and help I have received.
I know that I am honored to be in care for my Mom. She has done so much for the family through the years. My family seems somewhat disconnected and slow to learn so there has been obstacles with them as well.
Someone told me that caring for my Mom will continue in a different way now that she is a nursing center resident. Everyday, I must go see her. Everyday, I must be there for her and yet sometimes I can't and I have a hard time with myself on those days. 
I do now believe that Hope comes with the many support groups, people, and resources that are available to us, so I keep searching each and every day. 
Thank you for sharing and please know that we caregivers that ""spring up"" in the family are not alone.
Take care and know that you are doing the right things, even when it does not feel like it.
With High Regards,
Max in Texas

But, if no one tells DMV about the diagnosis, he could have gotten his license renewed with nothing but a vision test.

  Dear housrwv,
  Thank you SO much for posting that.....it really hit home!
  My wife has a seizure disorder, emphysema and a few other serious conditions. WE have been in and out of doctors' offices for well over two years.  NObody brought up her mental state.  She was OBVIOUSLY confused much of the time. And she'd be quick to tell them that she is a retired nurse, so how come nobody questioned the ridiculous things she would say related to health issues????
  This seems to be a common problem, and it has been discussed on this board. Like you, I'm FURIOUS that we didn't get help sooner.  Since there are a lot of smart people in our family, how come none of them didn't pick it up?
  Our story got really bizarre when in March of this year, my wife went to the hospital and then spent 4 weeks in rehab in a nursing home.  Their response to her behaviors?   Dope her up.....keep her quiet.  We had to chase the visiting psychologist around the building a few times to get an evaluation.  The psychiatrist was nowhere to be seen, but he wrote prescriptions for stuff like
Klonopin.  And since my wife had back pain, she got some opiates.  All of which didn't help with confusion and moods. 
  Meanwhile my daughter (a teacher) and I (with some medical expertise) ran around trying to get SOME help. Looking back, I realize that it was a ROTTEN nursing home.  And my wife was there for rehabilitation after pneumonia.
They didn't care whether she starved or flipped out.  As long as she got her
hour of PT every day.  MORONS!!!!
  I fear that this ""look the other way"" approach to dementia is common in the medical community.  We could speculate as to why this is so.  But who cares?   I don't have time to sue anybody or become an activist right now.
I need to take care of my wife and mySELF. 
  The medical community is going to be difficult to deal with.  I see a myriad of examples of this as I read the posts on this board.
  So I guess we have to help ourselves and each other.  And not expect much from a huge industry that SHOULD be doing much more for this horrible epidemic.

Here is where we find the THEY who tell you the real deal - and have wonderful creative suggestions about how to cope with some of the day to day issues - and give empathic support from those who really 'get it'.

     The most important reason for seeing a neurologist is to get a specific diagnosis. The word ""dementia"" simply describes the symptoms we see. It is not a diagnosis. There are well over 30 reasons for developing these symptoms (dementia) and many of them are treatable. The treatable ones include things like thyroid problems, medication side effects, b12 deficiency, normal pressure hydrocephalus, depression and others. Many of the rest are treatable but not curable. Alzheimer's is one of these and the one we see most often. If she has Alzheimer's, there are drugs that can help her brain function more efficiently for a period of time, but they do not change the course of the disease.
She could also have more than one type of dementia. Only a neurologist can pick this apart and make sure she gets the right treatment.
You may wish to let him follow her progress in case she needs a change in medications.
  Hope this answers your questions,

We like to go biking and our air compressor to put air in our bikes wasn't working.  My husband who normally could fix anything couldn't remember how to work the compressor and when we bought a new compressor I had to figure it out as I do for everything in our house.  I don't mind doing that but when he argues with me and blames me for things when he doesn't remember, I just get so sad and angry at the same time.  We finally had to take the compressor back to the store and have the clerk put it together for us.  My husband had disconnected a piece and he stripped the threads to it but of course it was my fault.  Needless to say we didn't go biking.  Nothing is his fault and everything is my fault.

Anosognosia ICD-10 R41.8 ICD-9 780.9
Anosognosia (/æˌnɒsɒɡˈnoʊziə/, /æˌnɒsɒɡˈnoʊʒə/) is viewed as a deficit of

seems unaware of the existence of his or her disability.

Surfergirl, how wonderful that your husband died peacefully at home.  That is what I would have wished for my husband.  Unfortunately, my husband was subjected to an agonizing death.  I will never forgive myself for handing him over to people who could care less about his well-being.
Anna, Still Waters, I also had social workers who told me and convinced me to make decisions that I later regretted.  Now that I think back, they had a manipulative way of patronizing and making me feel they knew better.  They are trained to that, at least the ones I dealt with. May God forgive me but I despise them.
Still Waters, going back to your question, if my husband knew he had dementia, he would not have wanted to live anymore because there is no quality of life with that illness. However, even with his dementia he still enjoyed eating, and drinking, and hearing music. He deserved to live a while longer and yes, he died too soon.

While I do agree that there is quality of life and even dignity at even the most advanced stages of this disease, it is not the same quality of life that a healthy person experiences.  It also concerns me greatly that dementia is still thought of by the majority of the population as a ""blissful state of forgetfulness"".  I can't even count the number of people who have said to me ""well at least she doesn't remember or understand what his happening to her"".  This couldn't be further from the truth.

I so appreciate you sharing about this. I, too, have struggled with the question of what to tell our young-adult children. I also think there can be a gender difference, depending on the people, but I do see that difference in my sisters' and friend's families who have daughters and sons.
I've tested the waters with our sons. I got mixed results and hesitate to risk their turning away. I may try again when the issues become more intense for me; when my pain overcomes caution. Is that selfish to let it surpass caution? (It could be sooner than I think if I let an emotional impulse rule the day. The way our finances are going south was not planned for, and figuring out the alternatives ... I find mind boggling at this age.)
They are loving and kind sons, but I don't know that they have the life experience or the desire needed, to be of real help with sorting it out. I don't want to be a burden as they forge their way in their challenging lives, and don't want to find them distancing themselves from us more than normal. It feels like a precarious balancing act, my relationship with them. I've already got a big one here at home. I would be a precious gift to be closer to them however.

  My advise is to keep doing what you're dining.  Ignore her rants, and keep a steady flow of I love you mom coming.  She will eventually get over her anxiety and reluctance to accept what is, and will get along much better.   You will only prolong the anger/anxiety by giving in to it, or trying to correct her.   Keep smiling and keep visiting and keep reassuring her that she is okay and that you love her.  
  On days when you are really short of patience, either stay away that day or go, but keep your visit short.  
  My wife did this as well, and it lasted a few weeks.  Then magically, one visit it was gone and has not returned.
  They can't understand what we can.  She probably doesn't know where she is or why. and you should not try to explain.  Offer to go with her to an activity or two or to help her meet a new friend.  Maybe bring an ice cream or a favorite snack and sit and share it with her.  
  Just know that this is not a permanent thing and will pass.   As for you, keep hydrated and when you leave her for the day, then ""leave"" in all respects.  As you drive away, thing about anything else in your life.  (or maybe just your driving - taking it one minute at a time).

That way, you can be assured beforehand that is what they will do if you have to call 911.  If the police do this, then they come in a squad car and they may have to handcuff your FIL IF he is being aggressive.  They won't hurt him, but they will take him to the county hospital that has a geri psych ward and he will be admitted involuntarily.  The other question to ask is which hospitals in your area have a geriatric psych ward.  If, for some reason, the police don't know, call your FIL's doctor's office and ask the nurse about this.  The nurse should know.  If you need to, you can always ask his doctor to refer him for a geriatric psych evaluation.  The way it usually works with a doctor's referral  is you take your FIL to the ER and the ER doctor admits him to the geri psych ward.

  It has been almost a week since our neurologist appt. and what a week it has been!  Rod realized that he is not functioning as well as he thought. That came from being unable to draw the shapes on the mini mental. He has had some architect training and  been good at things like that. He even drew the plans for our house over 30 years ago. He has been really hard on himself since then. Sometimes I wish we would get to the part where he doesn't understand things like that.  I have known for months that he cannot follow two-step directions.
But I empathized with him because the visit has caused me to face some hard cold facts. Things I knew but had pushed to the back burner.
  Besides that my computer died.  I bought a new one on Friday; returned it on Saturday because I did not like it, tried to call Dell and they dropped my call three times.  So I went back to shopping locally.  Finally found one and now I am adjusting to it.  It is just not as easy to do as it once was.  I now have Windows 8.

My sweet friend that will be married soon is having pictures done today, so I get to fix her hair this afternoon also.  I signed up for a class tomorrow from 9-4....my son will be on duty. I am looking forward to it. I will be married 44 years tomorrow. Yeah us!  I am so thankful that my life included a faithful friend.
I was able to stop the Plavix I needed to take after surgery, it has been really messing with my stomach. I feel bad for those that have to take things, That make other parts worse. Sarah comes to mind
Just found those faces! I haven't been able to download any pics yet.

Have a great day. I am praying for a spot Sandy.

Dear Sun,
You do persist in publishing your erroneous statements and so I shall persist in refuting such.
Aricept has been proven to be an effective treatment for slowing the progression of the disease. It has never promised to cure the disease. For most who take it, it has delayed the progression of the disease.
You come up with your own definition of words. That's your right but it makes your writing difficult to comprehend when your definition differs from the common one.
You compare Aricept to an antibiotic. It is not.
I take a great many medications, none of which cure the condition for which they are taken. I still have these many conditions, but they are under control.  I take them of my own free will because I know what my future holds if I don't take them.  Obviously my doctor thinks the are necessary or they would't be prescribed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please cite your studies.  Whenever you go against the current science, you should always cite the studies.
Because that is not the technical scientific ""biological"" action of the medication. 
Aricept is a ""choline enzyme inhibitor."" 
When the neurons fire, they fire ""choline""...which hits the receptors...and then an enzyme immeditately breaks down the excess choline.  This happens in a split second.  Aricept blocks the enzyme (NOT TREATS THE DISEASE PROCESS), so that more choline (aka neurotransmitter) remains.     
This gives the ""appearance"" of helping the disease (to those who do not understand the action of the drugs or the disease process) because as the brain's neural network is being destroyed having MORE neurotransmitter can give one more to work with.  Giving the appearance of increased function. However, the disease is still doing its dirty work.  Hence why, when people go off Aricept (and the like) there is often an immediate huge decline (the true place of the disease process). 
Aricept (and the like) are comparable to...oxygen given for bad lung function.  Not unlike those with bad lungs benefit from having MORE oxygen...however, the increased oxygen does not ""TREAT"" the bad lungs, just helps the person get by better.
Now, many may draw the wrong and false conclusion, that a person with an O2 tank is not that sick...because they can function so well with the O2, but they would be sadly mistaken.  In the same way, many may draw the SAME wrong and false conclusion about those with dementia and/or Alzheimer's on Aricept and the like. 
Choline does not TREAT Alzheimer's...IF IT DID - WE WOULD ALL BE TAKING CHOLINE. 
Some really do (like myself) appreciate having more neurotransmitter to work with.  I take Aricept and Namenda...and I can do so much more with them.  But I would never delude myself - or, omg, others - into thinking that it is HELPING the disease itself...because it is not. 
You need to be clear.  Really, really clear on what Aricept truly does...and does not do. 
Again - IT IS A DECISION THAT EACH PERSON WHO HAS DEMENTIA, and their caregiver, NEED TO DISCUSS WITH THEIR DOCTOR...and DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER OR NOT TO TAKE IT.  Not an outsider looking in.  Not a bunch of people, and non-practicing doctors on the internet, throwing their fears and opinions around. 
If Mom and Dad decide not to Aricept - that is PERFECTLY OK...and the support you give to non-caretaking son or daughter is, to help them be OK with Mom & Dad's decision...not to scare them into trying to override their parents and possibly wreck their relationships with them.  You explain calmly and clearly what the med can and cannot do...and all can see that it truly doesn't matter to take or not take it.  And you step aside...and not waylay the thread to personally attack someone...just because you can.  
And, because you will not quit, let me tell you something then.  You only have MCI, I am stage 6 Alzheimer's...and you were a doctor to boot. Do you have any clue how absolutely frightening it is to me, that I know more than you about Aricept (and the like)...there is something seriously wrong with that picture.  And you, the Admins, and the Asso needs to wake up...and start getting MORE advanced in knowledge of this disease than the actual people with the disease...and start to be there for us, rather than the other way around and us needing to educate you.  I don't want that role, and I am shocked, horrified, and dearly resent being put in it...but by golly, in the absence of it, I guess I still have a niche to fill...and while I still can, and just so long as I still can, I will CORRECT the false information out there - for the betterment of EVERYONE with the disease, for those who love them, and for those who care for them.  And while we are at it, how about trying this novel new idea...how about trying, just trying, just once to be ""supportive"" of people with the actual disease on this forum?  What say you?   
But even if you still refuse to be supportive, remember, I can always back my claims...in kindness, you might try Googling what I am saying BEFORE, you jump into a knee jerk reaction.  Just sayin.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donepezil
""Donepezil, marketed under the trade name Aricept, is a medication used is in the palliative treatment of Alzheimer's disease.[1][2] Donepezil is used to improve cognition and behavior of people with Alzheimer's, but does not slow the progression of or cure the disease.[3]
Common side effects include loss of appetite, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, vomiting, or muscle cramping.[4]""
""Donepezil acts as a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.[5]""
""Medical uses[edit]
Alzheimer's disease[edit]
There is no evidence that donepezil or other similar agents alters the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A 6 to 12-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition and/or behavior.[3] The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends donepezil as an option in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.[6] The person should, however, be reviewed frequently and if there is no significant benefit it should be stopped.[6] In 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also approved donepezil for treatment of mild, moderate and severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease.[7]""

  My mom has been hand fed since 2009. At that time, she still had a good appetite, ate regular food, but just couldn't feed herself. I was very surprised she needed hand feeding so early in the disease. She was still ambulatory , still continent but needed some assistance with toileting, Since then she has of course declined, and is now mid stage seven and under Hospice care. All food must now be softened (pureed), and she eats a reasonable breakfast, but very little at lunch or dinner.
  Mom's disease has followed the stages outlined in The Seven Clinical Stages of Alzheimer's, as defined here: alzinfo.org which is a link to the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation. Just google ""seven clinical stages of Alzheimer's"" and that should bring you to their definition of the stages/substages. It's a good guideline for what lies ahead.
  Of course, as in most cases, mom's timeline differed somewhat from substage to substage.

2.  Go to a park, pack sleeping gear and alarm clock, drinks and go to sleep.

  mom has acquired new words, formed new sentances and more,

Now, I don't need to do it as she will stop me (a firm tug on my hand and she stops walking) and we look at each other hug or kiss, and continue on...she does this 3 or 4 times during any given walk...
    I assert therefore that since this is not behavior of normal people who walk, I taught it to her and she learned it and repeats it.

Mina, the trend is towards earlier diagnosis.  The benefit of earlier diagnosis is the patient can begin medication quickly to improve functioning and help prolong the early stages.  The other benefit is to enable the patient to make decisions and preparations regarding her future.  Just the sort of things you are contemplating.  The decisions don't have to be made all at once, but better sooner than later.

  Bela is correct that facilities that accept medicaid money are not allowed to have these restrictions.  So what this tells me is that your father is in a private facility.
  And while I could go on (and have) forever about this out dated, cruel, and simply ridiculous rule, all I can say is, DON'T LEAVE YOUR FATHER ALONE.  It's not fair to him or his family.  He is confused, and now displaced, and he needs your face to remind him that things are still ok.  If it were me, I'd pack a bag and move in with him, until he adjusts.  That's exactly how I handled all hospital stays as well.   
And why can't you challenge this lack of wisdom.  If I'm correct, you are paying for their SERVICE.  And as a paying customer, you do have the right to question this rule.  And if you need any support on this, just remind yourself and the staff, that facilities accepting medicaid money are not allowed to keep family away.  So if it works for them, it can also work for this facility.   There is no acceptable rationale for this attitude, or this rule.  (Just watch how quickly this facility would change this rule, if paying customers were walking out the door. Somehow money can produce AH-HA moments.)   
This is 2016, for goodness sake, and the only way these things change, is if the consumer demands change!     I would be very suspicious of any facility who refuses to allow family to visit their LO for any amount of time.  In essence then, with all that your father has lost, this facility is now demanding that this disease is even allowed to take his son away from him!!   When you, are the one thing your father needs more than ever right now.

27361.4,"Bill, of course you are devastated! It is one of the most horrible moments in living with this disease. I can shrug a lot off myself, but that one haunts me too.

Remind yourself it is the disease and ask yourself these questions: Does she trust me? Does she like me? Does she look to me for answers and guidance? Does she feel comfortable with me? Does she follow my (simple) instructions? Does she eat the food I prepare? Does she allow me to help her with personal care? Does she feel safe with me?

I could probably continue this list, but I think you will get it. Love is so much more than romance; I believe love is the sum total of all positive emotions. If your wife continues to seek your support, your comforting presence, and feels safe with you, then it will not really matter what name she knows you by. That trust in you is instinctive and it is also built on the years that built that trust. We do not need names nor pedigrees to be important to someone we love.

While the past may not seem to exist for her anymore, or maybe her brain cannot access it, you can become the keeper of the memories. And you can build new memories, moments of laughter despite this awful disease. They are there if you look for them.

I suggest you read CREATING MOMENTS OF JOY by Jolene Brackey; this is a little book, easy to read, but it opened my eyes to the fact that I can create just moments of joy. I don't need to feel responsible for making hours and days happy; just moments. Remember, as they sing in HELLO DOLLY, ""It only takes a moment to be loved a whole life through.""

You are not alone on this journey and we are here for you to listen and console. Many of us have walked down this particular path and found comfort somehow even when we feel forgotten.

It is hard to talk to others who are your age but not in the same boat. Until someone has lived with this disease, they just don't get it. This journey will be one of the hardest you endure but at the same time it will teach you how to love and be compassionate during the most difficult situations and that is a valuable life lesson.
I wish that ALZ.org would create a message board for the children/young adults that have loved ones in the EO category. You can use the search function on this engine and type in key words like children of EO parents etc. then maybe you can find some here and connect thru connections. I know there have been similar posts to yours but I can't remember the names.
Again, I am so sorry. Try to stay focused on your life but still make time for your mom and dad. Dad will need some respite as well as this disease progresses. Cherish the time you have with your mom and make more memories while you can. Take it one day at a time and know, you are truly not alone.

1) please fill in your profile  ages, state of residence and frankly whether you have long term care insurance
2) The unfortunate horrible financial reality of this disease is that most people with Alzheimer's just became much poorer than they ever thought they would be.  Medicaid, not medicare is your absolute lifeline.
3)  If your spouse is totally uncooperative You may have to divorce them or otherwise leave them on their own.  Care taking KILLS caretakers .  Kills as in dead stone dead and buried and then you spouse is in a facility anyway.  My wonderful wife was a sweetheart but I had to tell her more than once if she did not cooperate I would not be her caretaker    It is that simple.I did it 24/7/365 for 5 1/2 years before placement.
 4) your first stop is an elder care lawyer . You are a community spouse . You need to know the rules inside and out.
5) You also need to study this disease and how you keep yourself from going crazy
6) You are in the right place.  Nice folks here

You could go backwards and challenge why the decisions are made but I would prioritize the going forward. Try to start with a memory clinic--these are group practices affiliated with teaching hospitals--they may have several of these specialties under one roof.

 My biggest challenge at the moment is getting her to accept the situation and work with me to have her be as independent as possible for as long as possible without sacrificing her safety or that of those around her. In addition I want to do as much as I can to help her slow the progression of the disease. That means preferably getting her a roommate for socialization, monitoring meds and activities, cooking, transportation, etc.  

Lmh, what you see as your biggest challenge may never come about.  Your friend may never ""accept the situation"" and ""work with you"" as you see it.  She may be unable to, due to the presentation of her brain disease.  This is something that is very important for you to understand, because many new caregivers use the patient's ""denial"" and lack of cooperation as reasons to withdraw from care, leaving the patient to her own devices.  This factor is called anosognosia, and there is no way to force your friend to be more aware that she is declining.   

By reading the posts from other members you will learn how to communicate with your friend in a new way so that you can ensure her safety while maintaining her dignity.  Talk with her as much as possible, but be aware that she may not be able to rationally plan a course of action and follow through. 

As much as possible, help her to make plans to be carried out as she progresses.  It's a good idea to formalize these plans in writing with an elder attorney. 

You have not mentioned her financial situation.  Will there be a need of Medicaid funding for nursing home care in the future?  Does she have funds for private pay?  This is what you can discuss with the elder attorney.

Re: roommate: since your friend already has dementia, she will need to live with someone who is willing to be proactive in her life.  She will need more than a roommate, who I think of as someone primarily there to share expenses.  She will need someone who will function as a family member, who will gently guide her into doing what needs to be done, such as eating meals, taking meds, while ensuring her safety, such as not using the stove. 

In other words, she will need supervision.  She will need supervision from a friend caregiver, or a paid caregiver.  There is much advice available on in-home caregiving. 

Keep reading and keep posting questions.  There is much for you to consider.

I always operated on logic and being rational. That goes out the door if it’s a dementia/Alzheimer’s. It’s really, really hard.
It’s a waste of your energy to try to convince them. Their brain is broken. They are incapable of remembering. 
Seeing DHs brain scans with so much atrophy/shrinkage was pretty convincing, in my case. But I finally convinced myself I needed to conserve my energy for better, more do-able things.

Asking him a question about something he is interested in might help or show him some pictures, anything to change the subject.

About the changes in relationships to a loved one, I find this very interesting.  In my mom's case, she was a great mother, but there were a few things that were difficult.  I know this is nothing in comparison to having an alcoholic parent, but my mom used to compare me to other people.  Her opinion meant so much to me and I felt like my accomplishments were never enough.   Then, in the earlier stages of the disease, I realized she stopped the comparisons.  I felt guilty about being relieved at this, because I knew it was the disease.  Now I see that these little positive changes make it easier to care for her. She is happy with anything I do (except taking her to day care!).
'
About family members dealing with the disease - I just accepted the fact that my sister will not be as involved as my brother and I are.  I was upset at first and now, well, I just let it go because she is the one who misses out.  My mom can still be very funny and we can laugh together.  On good days, I can marvel at what her brain retains.    

  And I can try to figure out new bits of information.  According to her, she rode horses when she was young.  I can't remember any horse stories, so I'm a little mystified by this.  ",0,1

Welcome Mike to the boards.   I hope it brings you some comfort to not be as alone on this journey,
I have a question, you mentioned that your friends wife was 60 and showed signs at 47.   I am curious when she was diagnosed?  
My DH was given the diagnosis in May 2012 of MCI with probably AD and a firm diagnosis of AD in 2014 at 53.   I know I saw signals at 49 but not about when it really started .... life was just too busy to tell.

Katy sue,
My DW had a bad reaction to Namenda when the doc tried to start her on it with the step regimen. She was also taking Aricept. DW is the sweetest, adorable, polite lady ever. After 3 days she experienced great anxiety and frustration trying to complete tasks and physically broke things in her frustration. This was starting with like 5mg day. I freaked out at the reaction, stopped the Namenda immediately, took off work a few days off work to ensure the reactions were over. That was over 2 years ago. 
This year, we decided to try it again to see if it was an anomaly then. Same scary reaction. This time the iPhone got smashed and thrown into the garbage. I watched her constantly as I immediately stopped the medication and within a couple of days back to normal. 
No more Namenda ever .....

My mother broke her pelvis on May 29th.  She has been in rehab since June 3 confined to wheelchair (she had been using a walker).  She managed to get herself undressed and ready for bed on the 7th.  On the 8th I asked for a chair alarm on the bed, the recliner and wheelchair.  On the 9th we received a call asking for permission to put a wander guard on her ankle.  Of course we agreed.  She had managed to wheel her self to the front doors and they just wanted to prevent something from happening.
Yesterday morning she was taken by ambulance to the hospital because the nurse found her on the floor next to her bed.  My mother like yours forgets she isn't supposed to self transport, and that she has a broken pelvis for that matter.
When I mention this possibility to the Dr and nurses they all look at me like I have have 3 heads.   When she was in the ER thrashing around, hallucinating and attempting to drink my hand because she thought it as a cup of coffee, I begged God to please take her. 
She was admitted for observations and is being discharged to rehab today.  The Dr. said the agitation was caused by the stress of the last week or so and it all came to a head.  He also said she had plateaued in terms of the disease?  Does anyone know what that means?

I know exactly what you are going through. I am an only child, teacher, mother to a 10 year old, and a wife to a husband that travels and works crazy mad hours. We recently placed my mom into a nursing home with a specialized dementia care unit. If my daughter was 10 years older, I would have kept my mom home, but it was affecting my daughter. My mom started waking up in the middle of the night and going for walks. We solved that problem by placing a dog gate in the hallway to block the front door and installing a door alarm. Then, my mom started waking us all up in the middle of the night. She would go into my daughter's bedroom and start crying about the man trying to kill her in our house. She also started to scream in the middle of the night that she wanted to go home and wanted to die. The last month she was here, my daughter slept in our bed every night. I was paying my mom's sisters to care for her during the day, and they kept cancelling on me and told me that they could no longer do it. It was the hardest decision I ever had to make, but I do think it was the best.

    One night my husband and I were watching a movie.   I watched as he got up and went to the BR about 4 times in one hour.    I asked what was wrong, and he kept saying he had the urge to go.  He also did go , when he got into the BR it was not just a feeling..  So I was concerned about UTI and said lets go and get it checked.  The Doctors office was closed and a weekend was about to happen so I took him to the ER.    I was once told that if you do not catch the infection soon, it can go into your bladder or Kidney.   So off we went to the ER.   They checked his urine and it was clear.   Than they asked him to go to the BR and void.    When he returned to the ER bed they came in with a large machine to scan his belly and see if he still had urine that did not come out.  His bladder was full.    So than they put in a cath..  Yes with had to leave the ER with the cath.   We were than told to get an appt with a Special Doctor that takes care of the Bladder, Kidney etc.    So on Monday morn I called one, and we had the appt by tues.    We went in and the Doctor removed the Cath.. He than checked the prostate and asked if my husband took any cold med's that were ""over the counter"".  My husband did take ""cough med""  for a cough.  So the Doctor explained that ""some cold med's over the counter can enlarge the prostate"".   When it became enlarged it stop the normal flow.   So he sent us home with a med called ""RAPAFLO CAPS"".   My husband took one a day. In three weeks we returned to the doctor for a check up.  We also had to have blood work done.  He was checking on several things along with the prostate.
All my husbands Blood work came back normal.   He said we could stop the med and see how he did.   But after a week on off the ""RAPAFLO CAPS"" We did notice it was coming back a little.  So he said my husband could continue the one pill a day.    We will return in 6 months to have everything re-checked.     I hope this helps...  But I have heard of a lot of patients having  prostate problems. Plus my husbands father had prostate surgery,  so I think this is going to be something we need to watch.   I hope this helps..

Thank you so much for starting this conversation!  I read through your post and the responses, and I feel so much better.  I try to be the best caregiver son that I can be,  but often feel like it's an unhealthy amount of time for one person.
     I started this to protect my mother, yet this morphed into: waking her, help dressing, food prep each meal, moment by moment entertainment and on and on as you seem to know. 
    I am just not a puzzle guy, on top of the fact that I have already spent so much time and energy fulfilling the daily requirements, with a pleasant tone and a realistic smile.  Anne44 wrote some of my exact feelings, no matter how much I do,  I feel like I could do more.  Maybe a natural feeling, but one I must override with logic often.  Helps to remind myself I am not alone in this.
   Balance really is important like caregiving daughter wrote.  I agree that not every day needs as much stimulation as adult center days (daycare).
    Store visits are mostly over for my mom too.  Like Allison, I don't feel guilty since it was progression of the disease that changed this.  It did make me tense to take her, but it was a great way to pass the time.  Now things are passed that.
   We will never be able to make their lives complete again. It is sad to watch and know that no matter how hard I work, I can't stop this disease.  My job is only to assist in making it better and more comfortable.

We had a good experience with Aricept.  My mom did not have any side effects and we noticed a difference in her behavior within days of taking the drug.  Basically it did what her neurologist had told us it might do, which was delay the progression of the disease. It did do that for about a year and a half which we were very grateful for, as it gave us time as a family to figure out how the heck we were going to deal with all of this. Her doctor told her that the drug worked in about half the population (they don't know why) and average delay in progression is about 18 to 24 months.  In our case, it was about 18 months on the drug when we started observing behavioral changes indication progression of the disease.  So I am a fan of Aricept.  My mom is now mid stage 7 and completely dependent on care and can no longer speak so there really is no way of knowing if the drug is still doing anything for her, but we tried twice in the past few years weaning her off the drug and noticed she lost cognitive ability and language so we put her back on and she did better.  So no harm (side effects) no foul in her case.  Hope this helps.  I have other post about it if you search ""maggs"" in the archive I believe you will find them there. Good luck to you.

Then, I found a day care center that works with state funds to assist with the enormous cost of day care (but only 3 days a week). Keep looking for funding sources. Sometimes it will seem that every door is shut, but then one in one hundred will open. Our local Office of the Aging is totally useless but I found the state helpful.
  Also, my evenings are a source of constant stress for me. I have no sanctuary. No privacy as my mother follows me into the bathroom. I must sleep with her. She is a very light sleeper and I can't even wait until she falls asleep to climb in bed with my husband because she opens up her eyes and begs me to get back into bed. My husband will not tolerate her noise, so I sleep with my mom.
  Benzodiazepines (Bzs) are really not an option as my mother gets dizzy and falls easily trying to go to the toilet at night. But everyone's constitution is different. I can't say Bzs will not work for others. I hate to suggest hiring help, but since you are home at night may be someone could be a companion to her during the evening hours since you can supervise the help's actions. I have had very bad luck with hired help. But my experience is not everyone's. Plus the area of the country where I live now does not have qualified people.

  remember the placebo effect doctors - it means our brains (and all the levels the brain functions on in our bodies) receive messages of hope or despair and then work to make that happen.
Our body is full of unexplored wonders, the Lymphatic system, the Heart and Gut Minds, and our expectations.
  I believe the patients can begin to consider that the ""usual progression"" of Alz is beyond what western medicine can do anything about, and their helplessness is imprinted on our outcomes.
  The pineal gland, access to The Divine Energies, our biologic pharmacy within us that sends out toxic cortisol and adrenalin fear chemicals are manufactured in an instant, at the moment of thought/emotion and circulated throughout the tissues in that instant. Perhaps we dare to change the DREADFUL illness of Alzheimer's prognosis by opening even a little to the concept it is not necessarily so. Environment of course if hospitable or not makes a huge difference. Acceptance and love makes a huge difference. An animal calms us. Good sleep restores us.
  While doctors try to find a ""cure"" or a new medicine to treat the symptoms, I am focusing on the loss of former brain function as a way to access the Mind Field, the Divine, to be in the moment, to be a new human being with a different consciousness.

He said that, people in a hospice is for those whom have 6months or less to live. He also went on to say that, if any other doctors are allowing their patients to go then that is illegal for medicare to have to pay for it. He told us that we can do what he had to do for his mom n that was to pay $15.00 per hour for someone to help. I like to flipped out n where the heck r we suppose to get that kind of money.
We even told him that I had a kidney transplant n going on my 10th yr n in case an emergency I would have to go to Atlanta n it would be more than one day up their n he seem like he was no concern.

48168.7,"I thank Myriam for recommending several practices that may help in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, for her positive comments, and for all her contributions to the clinical trials sections of this website.  Iris's advice is also quite helpful.
  The ""behavior"" of dementia patients is often quite disconcerting (to say the least).  Some aspects will always remain that way, and other aspects you are able to adjust and adapt to.  It is only natural to regret the loss of the person you once knew, but you have to remind yourself that this is who they are now.
  I think the most helpless aspect of Alzheimer's disease is the feeling that there is nothing you can do to stop its ravages. However, the idea that there is nothing you can do once the disease reaches a certain point is incorrect. 
  I began studying this disease eight years ago when my aunt and cousin were in the late stages of the disease and my mother was in the early stages of the disease.  For three years the disease confounded me.  I could not make sense of individual articles let alone how they fit together.  Then I found a reference to a toxin implicated in the disease--peroxynitrite.  I looked up peroxynitrite scavenger Alzheimer's disease on the internet and a month before an article had been published on how a peroxynitrite scavenger, rosmarinic acid, had protected against short-term memory impairment in mice.  I began giving my mother rosemary essential oil to smell (although it turns out the helpful ingredient in the oil is eugenol as rosmarinic acid is found only in the supplement).  After a month, she recognized that I had moved an object on her bookshelf and she said why have you been giving this to me to smell every day for a month.  I later realized that this was the first general area of improvement--she better recognized time and place.
  For three years, my sisters and I only gave her rosemary essential oil to smell.  Then, we began to research the compounds in the oils that seem to produce the positive effects.  They are called methoxyphenols (eugenol, carvacrol, thymol, geraniol) and they can be found in essential oils such as rosemary, thyme, sage, oregano, clove, cinnamon leaf, peppermint, bay laurel, Ylang Ylang, orange, lemon, grapefruit, frankincense, myrrh, and mountain savory.  The first ten essential oils I have used with my mother (I use about four or five essential oils at a time from a bottle; she smells them for a few seconds under each nostril once a day.  If you decide to use a diffuser or tinctures consult a trained aromatherapist to get the right dilution). 
  My mother still has Alzheimer's disease--she is not always lucid, she sleeps a lot during the day, she has troubles getting in and out of the car, she sometimes asks for her parents, she doesn't always recognize us.  She, however, now sleeps through the night, feels comfortable around her brother (who she used to think was an impostor), no longer asks why her parents are being left out in the cold, she recognizes her home, she can recite the alphabet and count to ten, she can complete simple phrases (such as April showers...bring May flowers and I scream, you scream, we all scream... for ice cream!), and she is much more alert and aware.
  By neutralizing and partially reversing the damage that peroxynitrites do in the brain, various essential oils not only stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease, they partially reverse it.

  Not sure I can answer all your complicated questions but I willing to share what happened to us.
  My husband was the POA for our loved one and we needed to be able to place her money someplace safe so we could pay for her AL care. Most of her money was in stocks from her previous employer. The court served ""us"" and our loved one. The state sent an attorney out to meet with our loved one, my husband was present,  he asked a series of questions. We then got a court date, we didn't have to be there, we were phoned by the state attorney that my husband was granted guardianship and we were able to care for her and pay her bills and take care of her care needs.
It was a fast and simple process, no pain involved. Our loved one was already an assisted living and we just carried on with her care there.
If your intentions are to place your mom into an AL, my suggestion would be to have all the care facilities checked out and if you decide on one, pay the admission fees. Then there is no fuss no muss when you take over Mom's affairs.
Good luck and let us know how things go.

12613.2,"Hello Bandaidbox and a very warm welcome to you.   This is a very good place to find understanding and support.   I am sorry for what is happening and that you have been unable to gain adequate medical assistance for what is present with your grandmother.  I am an RN whose mother, step-father, MIL and GMIL all had dementia. 
You are a very good advocate for your grandmother and it is a big positive that you are trusting your instincts and looking farther for answers; you are in all likelihood very spot on in what you are feeling is happening.
One question that I have, is wondering if the Neurologist had administered written and oral testing of your grandmother, not just a mini-mental test?   What is presenting itself in your grandmother is NOT ""old age.""   Old age is NOT an illness.  There will be a medical diagnosis to define what is present.  I am truly sorry that this was the outcome of your seeking help.
All people in all professions are unique unto themselves for their capabilities and so much more.  Sometimes we get the awesome professionals and sometimes not so much.   It would be totally reasonable to seek a second opinion.   One would need to see a dementia expert such as a Neurologist, who sees dementia patients as a routine part of his/her practice.
I would like to invite you to call the Alzheimer's Assn. Helpline at (800) 272-3900 for assistance.   If you call, please do ask to be put in touch with a Care Consultant.  Consultants are highly educated Social Workers who specialize in dementia.   Quite often, the local Assn. offices have contact information for dementia specialists, specialty dementia clinics, etc. in one's own local area.  This may be quite helpful in ensuring your grandmother receives adequate screening and diagnosis.  There is no fee for this service.   If you call, ask if you are speaking to your local office, if not; request to be transferred there.
That being said, I am hopeful that your grandmother's primary MD has examined and assessed her with a full physical exam and blood tests to rule out anything physical that could be causing or contributing to what is present.  There are physical conditions that can mimic dementia.   This is simply a ""rule out"" process.
The memory loss, the rigid false beliefs that are called ""delusions"" and the feeling of paranoia are indeed symptoms of dementia for many patients.  Your grandmother is feeling the actual impact of all of this as it is her truth.  It is of no use to argue, or try to change her mind; this is her reality and as real to her as the chair you are sitting on.  We have to enter their reality as they cannot process the real world we live in when this state is reached.  It is truly very responsible and caring of you to bring your grandmother to assistance which will make a huge difference in her quality of life.
We always do look to the dementia specialists for our Loved Ones (LOs) to bring about the best results.  There are multiple different types of dementia and it is extremely important to know just which type of dementia is present as treatment for one may well be contraindicated in another and make things worse if an incorrect diagnosis is made.  Neuro is indeed very good at diagnosing accurately for dementia type, so you are on the right path.
Hang in there, you are going in the right direction and this will get itself ironed out with getting that second opinion from a dementia specialist who will listen and conduct an adequate exam; calling the Helpline may be a great starting point to get this underway.
Also, please do be sure to let the specialist know in detail specifically what has been happening with your grandmother.   Our LOs often are able to ""fog"" the situation in a doctor's office.  I use to write a detailed memo outlining all the changes in cognition, behavior and function and any other pertinent information or concerns and get it to the doctor prior to the appointment or prior to his/her entering the exam room so the MD would have all the necessary information to make an adequate assessment.
Please do let us know how you are and how things are going, we will be thinking of you and I send best wishes for a good outcome.

  I have to be honest that I would not feel guilty engaging in a sexual relationship outside my marriage, at this point. Not at all.
  I was reading a book about caregiving and the author stated that at some point in the process of taking care of a loved one with a terminal illeness one has to understand that the path they are on is different from the path we are on.
  Our lives are diverging, whether we want to accept this reality or not. We can chose to keep on the same path as they are and go down with them, or realize that we need to live our lives and let go, by which I do not mean abodoning the person, but starting to detach on an emotional level, so we can live our own lives to the extend we can. This is especially true of this illeness, due to the fact that it can be unpredictably long lasting.

I know others here are much more able than I am to advise, but I wanted  you to know you're not crying  out to the dark. I hear you. I'm sure others here will hear you too.
Take a deep breath.

We didn’t know that he could qualify for health care benefits from the VA. He is 94 now and only in the last 12 years he’s been a VA patient.  We paid thousands of dollars for health care premiums because of our lack of knowledge of what the VA has to offer to the veterans.  At the beginning his coverage was limited but thanks to all the information available and persistence in reaching the right social worker he is now fully covered.  In my experience, you’ll get different answers from different sources.  I was told that he won’t qualify for hospice help and yesterday I was told by a different social worker that he will be getting hospice help when the time comes. We are in California.

I am so sorry to hear this news, my heart is breaking for you and your mom. You have been given some good advice. The hospital social worker should be able to advise you on hospice services and give you some referrals. If not have your mother's Dr. call in a order for it. Hospice services are wonderful. The book that has been suggested is a must read. It really helped me understand what was going to happen. I wish I had known about this book 9 years ago when my father was dying from cancer. My mother lived with me and I used hospice services in my home for her. I was very greatful for them. My goal was to keep mom comfortable. I have watched both my parents die, it is horrible but I would not change it for a minute. Knowing I was there holding their hands and letting them know how much I loved them helped me believe I made their transition a little smoother.
I went thru this 3 months ago today with my mom. She took a rapid turn for the worse. She did not want to eat or drink anything and was having problems swallowing. She too did not want any feeding tubes and no heroic measures to keep her alive. I would offer food or water and she decided if she wanted it or not. I had a very small syringe that I used to squirt small amounts of water into the side of her lower cheek. Hospice did not allow for IV fluids and I had read and was told by her Dr and hospice that pushing the fluids via IV made them feel worse.
My thoughts and prayers are with you all during this difficult transition.",1,1

25931.8,"I think most people don't speak up because they figure the doctor knows what he or she is doing.  And while nursing home employees cannot prescribe the drugs, they probably often make calls to doctors requesting that the drugs be prescribed to control the patient.   
    In most studies with aromatherapy, many of the patients have been taken off of anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety drugs (such as Ativan), and anti-depressants.  The question is how many of these patients should have been on the drugs to begin with or did the essential oil actually reduce anxiety and psychosis.

  It is complicated because certain essential oils can increase anxiety (by increasing adrenaline levels) and rarely by themselves but sometimes in conjunction with certain drugs increase psychosis (by increasing dopamine levels).  On the other hand stimulating essential oils by increasing cognition and mood in conjunction with relaxing essential oils that decrease adrenaline and improve sleep can decrease anxiety.  And stimulating essential oils by increasing blood flow and increasing acetylcholine levels can decrease hallucinations in certain cases. 
  The following study is not for essential oils, but for a product that contains methoxyphenols such as some essential oils.

Effect of ferulic acid and Angelica archangelica extract on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and dementia with Lewy bodies.
RESULTS:
Treatment with Feru-guard led to decreased scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory in 19 of 20 patients and significantly decreased the score overall. The treatment also led to significantly reduced subscale scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (""delusions"", ""hallucinations"", ""agitation/aggression"", ""anxiety"", ""apathy/indifference"", ""irritability/lability"" and ""aberrant behavior""). There were no adverse effects or significant changes in physical findings or laboratory data.
CONCLUSION:
Feru-guard may be effective and valuable for treating the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and dementia with Lewy bodies.
  So first of all, many anti-pyschotics, anti-anxiety medications, and anti-depressants are over-prescribed and secondly there may be effective alternatives.  The may is the critical word since these alternatives have only been studied by a few researchers and unfortunately by almost no one in the United States.

Besides it being much better for your health and sanity, I think some separation from the extreme issues at your parents house might also assist with helping them. Like previous posters, I also think a call to Adult Protective Services (APS) is in order. I would make these 2 things your top priority: getting out of that house and contacting a local government agency for guidance. It might even be more of an impetus for APS to take some action if you (a competent adult) are not living there. You need help and if you were not there to clean up some of the messes etc, the resulting fiasco might be enough for an agency like APS to really see the problem and take some action with you or for you. I think everything in your life will be improved once you are not living in that situation: it might even be a bit easier to help your parents. It’s sad that your sister has no interest in helping your parents. I hope that she would at least want to help her sister. Maybe you could tell her that you are trying to take on her share of the work but in order for you to do that, you need a safe and healthy temporary place to live.

The cost to create this village was $25 million with the Dutch government funding $22 million. I read an article from 2013 which stated that the cost to residents was a hefty $7000 per month. I don't know if that cost was for 2013 or from the time the village opened. In any case, not free. I also wonder if the Dutch government subsidizes that monthly cost.

It took me a day and some distance from that conversation to again acknowledge that it was not my mom talking, it was my ""Alz Mom"" talking.

  Often, the sensation of air moving across the skin is misinterpreted as ""cold"".  So since our loved ones can overheat if they're bundled too warmly, it can help to have them wear lightweight, long-sleeved shirts and slacks.  If they're inside, keep them away from breezes coming through an open window, fans, etc, and redirect air conditioning and heating vents so they don't blow directly onto people in the room.

So it's your sister who is suffering. The thing about this stage is the patient can become dangerous.  They have lost all inhibitions and they may attack their caregiver for some imagined slight.  Some Alz/dementia patients have even killed family members during this stage.  I think realistically, you need to either get a care company and bring in 24x7 caregivers or place your dad.  If you hire in caregivers, your dad might even think he's married to one or more of them.  Who knows how he will act.  The most important thing to keep in mind is not to contradict you dad no matter what crazy thing he says.  That is his reality and you need to join him in it.

I live 10 miles south of Decatur, Tx. So Lorita we are somewhat neighbors. What town or city or you close to. If you don't don't where Decatur is we are about 55 miles northwest of Dallas. 
We feed our cows cubes of a blended feed that we designed.  I drive the gator and DH loads and unloads them in the troughs.  We tried feeding large and small bales for years.,Hay and transportation were getting ridiculous in price. Another problem we couldn't count on the amount of protein our cows were getting. Our mommas were nursing calves with very small bags. We changed to the sack feed. In over a week those bags were plumping up. 
We have three cats. DH never cared for cats. Now he won't go to bed until they are all in the house.
We had a wonderful border collie named Rip. He was born on our place. His line went back to Winston Cap international champ of Scotland. He worked like a charm for us with the cattle.  Rip died last May at the age of 19 years and 3 months.  Needless to say it was hard to loose him. He is in the Texas Animal Hall of fame for saving my life from the cow that tried to kill me.

He was livid that I had been gone so long  (20 miles each way)  I'd had very little sleep with his getting back up after 2 hrs, sleep.so I was tired.  He was pouty the rest of the day.  One of his problems is that time hold little meaning for him.  Then on Monday we went to the store for a few items and he bought hankies.  they were on the counter and then they were gone...Someone had stolen them  Ballistic.  I went to look for them and found a $400 pr. glasses which I had had to replace because somebody ""stole"" them.   He is still very much in denial and at the same time knows he can't do mechanics, use the phone, the remote, etc.  He tries to help me so much that he drives me bonkers.  I'm still going to start a caregiver group but that takes time.  I mowed today and worked on getting summer clothes out and worked a bit on my 60th class reunion. This weekend he will just have to go to both masses with me.  I'm a Methodist but have played in about every denomination of church, so I like to play at his church as that can be a part of our gift to the church.  I should get to bed but it's banging away out there storming.  the worst of it is to the west of IA.  I don't do well with storms.   Have been too close to several tornados.
The other thing that is that is so disconcerting that he often speaks of me in the 3rd person.  When were have a pretty good conversation last evening about what' happening, he talks about the other people who live here and so blames the geriatrics specialist in Omaha for telling us he's crazy.  Now my rant for the evening is over and maybe I should try to get ready for bed.  I almost hate to go to bed as when he gets up at one or two, he haw no concept of time, so he gets dressed , gets breakfast ready and sleeps in the recliner.
On the upside I did get my boxes of flowers fixed for Memorial Day and my hanging baskets.  I still have 3 flats to plant but with such a stormy week I hate to put them out.  I do love my yard and flowers.  Have a number of flower beds.  So many stop and tell us they so enjoy seeing something in bloom all summer.  Good for the stress.  Thanks for listening and it helps to know that others are so ""homebound'. for this Gadabout, that's hard.

35684.6,"Our dog will be seven years old next month. He has always been my husbands dog even though I do all of his care.  My husband is somewhere near stage six.  About five months ago, every time my husband lays on the couch to watch tv in the afternoon our dog climbs in his own bed for a nap.  As soon as DH starts to fall asleep the dog jumps out of his bed  and puts front paws on his chest.  If this doesn't awaken him, he will bark until he wakes up and talks to him. The dog then lays down on the floor and goes to sleep until DH drifts off to sleep and he is up and pawing again.  This happens everyday. After awhile I can't stand it anymore and will take the dog for a walk.  The dog sleeps on our bed at night and never bothers him. I have studied DH as he starts to fall asleep on the couch to see if I could tell if breathing pattern changed or what was different but I see or hear nothing different.  The other thing is, if the dog is on DH lap and someone reaches for him the dog will try to bite them! Very strange.  As my DH fades away I sense sadness in the dog that wasn't there before. I am always near tears but I often do my crying while we walk and the dog is occupied.  Very touching.  I feel so bad for all three of us and all of you too.  God bless us all.",1,1

He, too,  did nothing but watch TV all day once I got him to quit driving - his ""go-to"" activity when he was bored.   THAT was cause for some rip-roaring arguments !!   I also had to put up with a lot of anger in the beginning, which has returned now that he has reached stage 6. 
  is he amenable to participating in any activities with you?  I take  Dan out when I run errands, he likes to get out of the house and ride in the car.  We belong to the local senior center and participate in some of their activities , although I can see that will soon stop as his disease progresses. 
  what do you like to do for yourself at home?  do you work on projects, read, sew, garden, etc?  It's important to find something at home for yourself , in addition to finding a way to get out on your own.

At the bottom of this page are white prompts which are also a service from the Alzheimer's Assn., one is titled, ""Local Resources,"" and the other is, ""Alzheimer's Navigator.""  At the top of the page is a prompt for, ""Solutions."" 
Each of these will provide information regarding different services and in some, even names and contact numbers of facilities and said other services in one's own zip code area.
NOTE:  These can be very helpful, but  as in all things there are often changes; so in the references that I mention that the Alz. Assn. has provided and also in the reference Michael has listed, these are great starting points but one can often find additional assistance in the community or changes that are not listed which is why Google is helpful.
The Helpline has been significant support for so many.  The Care Consultants are Social Workers who specialize in dementia and family dynamics.  They are wonderful listeners, provide much needed support and often can assist us with our problem solving.  In the worst of times for me, I found excellent input for over the top problem issues and found much needed emotional support for myself a couple of times.  We can also find help at our local chapters who often have specific information regarding support items such as memory care facilities, daycare entities, legal providers, and more within the community of our own zip code area.  NOTE:  As in all things, each center may be different because community dynamics may be different.
My greatest thanks is for this much needed and marvelous Message Board; ALZConnected.  I have been a Member since 2006; it was this wonderful Board and the compassionate Members who helped keep my head above water through the most difficult times.
Just think; we are provided this service at no cost to us; the Alzheimer's Assn. funds this, develops this, manages and oversees it and all that entails; that is no small thing.  Our donations and donations of others is what keeps this up and running.
I for one am grateful for the gift of this Board and for the dear Members of this community.

   I was tepmted to get one when I was looking for a new car back in 2005.  
But instead got a Lexus. It's a nice car but a 6 cylinder does not have the get up and go I like. It isn't bad but I like the fast take offs. Yeah, I waste a lot of gas the way I drive but not going to worry about it since the car only has 18, 200 mi. on it. 
   Had a Corvette back in 1984. Kind of got it the hard way. Step son has auto body shop and a man got his daughter the car for graduation. 3 weeks later she hit a tree. Since he had a trucking co. and the car insured under that he wanted to unload it. Otherwise ins. for whole fleet of trucks would have gone up. Husband paid for parts, and his sone did the work. Turned out real nice. 
   I remembrer when husband brought it home. I got in to drive and hit the4 gas pedal like our other car. Glad we have 100 ft. ofn driveway. Boy did that thing take off. Took a couple days toget used to it. B ut I did and it was such a comfortable car to sit in. 
    I drove it all year long even in the snow. Not the best but just take it easy.  Then the time coming ovrr bridge into town some guy giving me the business trying to cut into my lane. Got red light and whren it turned green I peeled out. As I did just happened to look in mirror and there was a police car. Uh, oh. I'm waiting for the siren but didn't get one. Next red light they pulled up in back and the 2 officers in the car were laughing.  Domn't know if it was at me but thankfully nothing happened. 
   But we had our problems with it. Or m,y husband did. He's tall and one time getting out of car hit his head and almost knocked himself out. Anothert time gettin g out he got his foot tangled up in brake and gas pedal and fell out in the driveway. Of course he blamed the car. 
   The somone backed into the door and another time husband was over at his son's shop and delivery person in a box truck backed oover the front end. They had to jack the truck up to get the car out.

35899.4,"Crushed...not certain that I understand about the inertia but I do agree, marriage requires more than one person but to me it never meant ""commitment"". It was a public statement of a relationship.
When my husband and I met is was as if pixie dust (a description my daughter uses) had been sprinkled. We simply were, from that point on, together. We did not live together until we were married 3 years later but there was no question about our being connected. 
I never viewed our relationship as a partnership. We never really acted thoughtfully as a team. We were, in my opinion, one entity. That is not to say that there were no differences, anger, hurt , disappointment and days that walking out the door was not seen as a reasonable solution but mostly we just moved through life joined in some undefinable way.
I never thought about commitment while my husband was alive and certainly did not care for him during illness because of a marriage vow. I simply wanted to be with him and it was not until he died that I felt him missing. Sure, there were things that I missed terribly like conversation both meaningful and totally meaningless but he was still there.
 I am certain that the fact that he did not stop knowing me until the last months made our journey different from yours. I also think the fact that our lives took on a new quiet direction made life easier. We gave up travel. Put the Santa Fe house on the market and settled in. Books, TV, drives became the norm ...it felt natural. As I said somewhere, I felt the bond between us deepen. 
As  you progress through this dread disease I think you will find the bond with your loved one change too. You will love her no less. Using your terminology, she may become not your ""wife"" and the relationship you call marriage may no longer exist but the love and care you give will not be from a sense of commitment due to those words. Instead it will come from  a place deep inside.
I hope that you are able to get in some help...it really is help if you find the right person...not easy to find. Being rested and having something outside of 24/7 manually caring for someone is a goo thing and can bring renewed joy to both of you.

I was told I would need to do this for my own mother at some point. Perhaps it would be a way to spend down her income in a way that would help her qualify for the services. From what I understand, pre-paid funerals (up to a point) are allowed as a spend down. If you arrange for something like this, perhaps you could have the total amount divided up to equal $240 a month. Just a random thought.

The anosognosia, along with him thinking I'm the one with a problem (no I do not discuss anything with him or argue with him anymore) has started to be a great concern. He is very good at appearing 'normal' to those on Facebook. He's on for very short intervals, then rest up, then back on, then rest. He said he has talked to several  ( in messages) about my problem. He blocked me last night after I asked him to delete a comment he'd made pertaining to me. How he figured that out I have no idea. But he's also been going to church alone after he told me he told our pastor I needed marriage counseling ""but I refused to go"". He has isolated me from the small community I was involved with due to his behavior. DH has 7 out of the 9 defining traits of narcissism (my father was so I knew what it is). I'd chalked his behavior up prior to seeing dementia symptoms to him being selfish (narcissistic) but IF he's diagnosed then how does one handle a narcissist with PWD?

  Assisted Living Facilities I have visited, all with on site dementia units, all claim it probable that the patient could live out their lives there without ever needing a nursing home. At the appropriate time Hospice is brought in. 

When looking, be sure to ask: under what circumstances would my mom be asked to move?  ALFs vary considerably in the services they provide and especially charges. Be sure to find out what extra charges are incurred for what services. There is no standardizations.

There are also other types that are like upside down Us, that go under the mattress. It may be enough of a deterrent that it may prevent your mom falling out of bed. I would ask the facility first what they allow and they may very well have some excellent suggestions.

32780.2,"Happy October!    It's going to be hot for family day at the Firefighter Academy on Thurs. so I had to go to a store I love in another town. I wanted a pair of capris and a new shirt. They had a big sale on them.  I ended up with 2 pairs and two nice loose fitting blouses. Didn't want to spend the money, but I lost most of my nice capris in the move. I think they got thrown out because it took me awhile to get everything I needed from the house.  So, naturally, I was a tad upset that I had to go clothes shopping as I hate that with a passion.  I found an old gift card in my wallet and thought that there was probably only enough on it to pay for half of what I bought.  I was so delighted to see that it not only covered what I purchased, but I have enough left over to get a fair amount next time!  I love those kind of surprises!
I also found an old one from Tractor Supply and was able to buy my supplies. I didn't take out my credit card once.  When my family wants to know what I need for birthdays and Christmas, I will request gift cards! Especially for those two stores. Tractor Supply is a heavy bill every few weeks.  I might not eat great, but my animals sure do.  Actually, I have lost weight and can't believe I fit in a size 6 pants. Down from size 8 and before that a size 10. I think I better stop loosing it now. Of course I am the only one doing all the heavy lifting and stall cleaning, mowing, weeding and the puppy keeps me hopping.  Lorita, she is a beagle and just turned 8 mos. but still acts just like a puppy. Total energy. What ever possessed me to get a beagle pup, I have no idea. But she is sooo cute.
As far a lifting goes, I can't twist either.  I have to lift straight up and use my abdominal muscles. I can't use my legs because of my knees so have gotten creative.  My feed comes in 50 lb bags that I can't lift myself.  So the feed store puts it in the back of my suv.  When I get home, I get my kubota and back it up to the opened tail gate of the car and slide the feed bags onto the back of the kubota. Then I back up to my feed room and drag the metal feed cans out to the back of kubota and open and dump in the cans, then drag them into the feed room.  The only thing I really lift in the barn area is my hay bales(sq. bales) and manure muck buckets. They are also put on the back of rtv.  I open the bales of hay on that and then divide out from there.  The sq bales are around 50/60 llbs.     I do have to lift them up there a little bit, so I lift enough to balance on my hip and they can get them in there.  This getting old is for the birds.
  I had an indentation on my metal hose too. Either I drove over it with RTV or one of my girls stepped on it. Barely put a dent in it.
My ex told my daughter that he was worried he was getting alz. I thought he was showing signs of something after his stroke.  He has an airplane that he just got his medical back to fly it as a sport pilot. At least so he says. Anyway, he took it up Sunday and got confused and disoriented. He turned around to go back to the airport and landed it but he forgot to check to see if the gear was down. So he did a belly flop.  He is ok, but he is one ticked off man and said he will never fly again and that he is closing his aviation business in Dec.

So sorry your mom and family are on this journey. It is very hard for our loved ones to lose their independence and them not wanting to leave their own home in which they feel safe and secure. Some have had great success moving their loved ones while others have not. I was fortunate that I was able to care for my mom in my home until the end. She did not have the means to pay for a nice facility with a great reputation and even if she did, she would not have adjusted well at all. Having broken both her hips over a period of 5 years and having to spend weeks in a rehab facility, she did not do well there at all. She was scared and could not comprehend why she had to stay there.

24365.24,"'Sheri asked what I DO recommend when placement is necessary. That would depend on the stage of dementia and the types of facilities available to you.
If someone is in the early stages of dementia and has several years of still being able to maintain their own self care, can go to a dining room etc. Most ALFs will memory care units will offer what they need. Just be aware that at the point that they are having problems with increased confusion, wandering, incontinence etc. they will need a higher level of hands on care. That is where I have a problem with many ALFs. They charge for extra service and because there is no real supervision of nursing assistants on weekends or evening and night shifts, I prefer to see people with dementia in nursing homes.
     Lets look at the idea of ALFs. They are set up to market to the Adult Child. Most look like beautifully decorated hotels. This is not exactly the way most people live, but families want to place their LO in the lovely environment they offer. Their activities are usually geared more toward active residents and a fairly functional person can live their comfortably. ALFs have dementia units, but again, even though the staff may be well trained in dementia care when emergencies happen and a nurse is not around to do an assessment, the aides make the decisions. They probably will call the nurse for advice, and at times she will come in to assess an injury or problem, but descriptions of incidents given over the phone don't tell the whole story and even if a nurse comes in, the resident will be laying on the floor the whole time, waiting for her. I just don't like this model for mid to late stage dementia patients.
     Now lets look at NHs. They are not the ""snake pits"" of years ago. Like ALFs, there are good NHs and not so good ones. Visit several and you will probably find one with a really good dementia unit. The environment on that unit will be dementia friendly and the staff will be well trained in dementia care. The main difference is that the quality of physical care will be much better. This includes assessments by nurses if someone feels ill, has a fall, has a significant behavioral change, etc.
    This is just MY opinion. You will have to decide for yourself what is best for your mom. I'm sure that you will get several responses from people who were happy with ALFs and some who were very disappointed. Only you know your LO best and know what they need. You will also be the one seeing the facilities. The trick is making the right match.

For myself,  at some point reading articles that urge me to ""keep your chin up and just try to have a laugh"" are nothing more than hollow words. It feels like a judgment of me and my effectiveness in dealing with my emotions and fears.  When I feel that way I usually won't comment and prefer to just drop out of the discussion.

   You sound like a loving son and it must mean a lot to her that you have stepped up to help. Even though she may not say it, or can't say it, she loves you for helping her.
Yes, you do need respite at least a few times a month. How about your brothers helping out with some money if they can't physically come. They probably don't realize what you are going through. Use the money to pay for day care and send mom at least 3 days a week. Day care would be good for you both. Mom will get socialization, stimulation, activities and the supervision she needs.  You, in turn, will get the day to yourself.
You also need to ""Alzheimer proof your house"".  There is a book called ""The complete guide to Alzheimer's Proofing your home"" which can help a lot and you can get a used copy on Amazon.
Meantime, lock the rooms you don't want her in, and put alarms on the top of any doors leading out. This will help keep her from wandering away at night. Consider putting one on her bedroom door as well.
She needs activity during the day. Does she like  to get into things?  Give her acceptable things to get into. Fill one of her purses with a pretty scarf, handkerchief, brush, tissues, pictures, used ticket stubs, anything else you can think of that she might like to rummage through.
Also, you have to remember that in a sense you are the adult with the responsibility for her safety. She is not capable of making those decisions. When you decide that it is time for her to go into a MC unit, do it for both of you.  Like day care, MC will give her the same supervision, socialization, activity, exercise, etc. that she needs.  Yes she will be mad, but she will come to accept it.
May I also give you a link to a lot of information for new forum members regarding caregiver resources?  Here it is:  https://www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g=posts&t=2147523850
This is an updated (6/20/2017) list of links about information care givers will need  
    The first is a very helpful article is:  ""Understanding the dementia experience""  It will give you an idea of what your mom is going through, and what she needs to have a good quality of life.  ""Communication skills""  demonstrates better ways for you to communicate with her by encouraging  cooperation  and reducing  the chance of negative behaviors.
   There are many other links included which will be more applicable, and very helpful as your mom's dementia progresses.

Like your dad she could care less what anyone else is doing or what their opinion is.  She is way too smart to be tricked.  She becomes very verbally aggressive even when you are not because she knows she makes way better decisions than anyone else and she is going to convince you so.  She had a stroke a few weeks ago and refused to go to hospital.  A few days later she got down in the floor and couldn’t get up.  She went to hospital but refused  medication for high blood pressure because  she knows she doesn’t have it.  She thinks the doctor and nurse she didn’t like made it up.  When that doctor and nurse became aggressive with her she became extremely verbally aggressive.  The doctor and nurse who were calm with her got no better results just less drama.  I know why your name is anxiety girl.  I could be anxietygirl ll, lol.  
Hopefully you can find some way to lower your anxiety.  I lived with her 15 years.  I moved out a little over a year ago.  I had to or something was going to happen to me physically.  My heart fluttered and my stomach jumped a lot.  That is 95% less now.  I tried to equip her with a medical alert system after the stroke and she refused that. I have tried.  I get her groceries, provide her a home to live in, see that the bills are paid and check book balanced.  I am not strong enough to do anymore.

25988.7,"Dearest Katie:  I am sorry that the news was much more dire than you and your husband had expected.  It can be a bit of a shock to have such an outcome to say the least.
  Your FIL is blessed beyond measure to have you in his life; you and your husband are wonderful care providers and advocates for him. 
  I also understand the pain your husband is feeling and the heartache this brings to you on his behalf.   Because your FIL has functioned at a fairly high level without dramatic downturns and his behaviors have been fairly benign, it was probably not able to be easily seen to what level the dementia had evolved.  What a shock for your husband!   
  From all the years of marriage in my personal experience, (others may have a different experience), I found my husband to have similar dynamics and this was so with his mother when she had dementia and a downturn in her condition.  He wanted to be her protector as he always had, and he wanted to fix something and there was also probably a bit of denial in there too. 
  It took a bit of time for him to process all of the changes and what they meant in real time.  There were no magic words to say to him to make things better in the instant.  I was there to listen to him when he was ready to talk.  Sometimes these ""talking moments"" came at odd times - in the car in a parking lot as we were leaving a store; late at night when he was feeling more open, etc.  just let yourself listen and let him know you understand, care deeply and share his feeling of loss with him.  Sometimes I was able to gently open a conversation  to let him vent and express himself and to reassure him.
  I think it helped to let my husband know that I would be there to support everything; his mother and him all  the way to the end and that we would make it as easy as could possibly be for his mother.
  Lots of soft hugs and saying, ""I love you.""  Making favorite meals and/or desserts here and there (comfort food).   Getting him out to a dinner with just the two of you if you can - a bit of respite.  Talking about the past with my husband as it related to his Mom; recalling good memories and holidays, etc.
  It can't be forced, it must all move at it's own pace.
  My husband took a bit of time to get his mind caught up with the shocking reality and to process things, but as always, he rose to the occasion.
  We then became a team of partners in a bit of a different sort of way and it worked well.  We found ways in which my husband could contribute to his Mother (not good at hands on type of care) in a loving way and we consulted on different facets of her care so he was involved in the  way he found acceptable. 
  I still continued to have to manage the dynamics, but that was okay.  He was SO loving to his mother and he sat and talked with her even when we weren't sure she was able to process such interaction, but it was him giving of himself to her.  He also ran many errands on her behalf, etc.  Yet, when push came to shove and doctors were involved or something needed to be addressed, I was the ""go to"" person - but then, I am the RN and that was the reality.  You are in the process of becoming an RN, so it is a simlar dynamic.
  With your loving presence your husband will process the news that was so shocking to him and he too will adapt and rise to the occasion.  Tincture of time can be a great healer.
  Also, if your husband should find it helpful, he could also come to the Message Board to talk about things - my husband would never do so, but that is just him - not a public sort of guy.
  I send you my very best wishes,

Us traveling quickly went beyond my ability to handle it, physically or mentally. Things he did at home—getting a drink or fruit, turning on a light, dressing himself, using the toilet—he could not do in unfamiliar surroundings. Then it was meltdown time—along with meltdowns for no discernible reason, which also did not happen at home.

Of course we must keep doing what we are doing for the safety of our LO but what helps is to stop trying to explain things or talking about why you now must take over her meds but just do it and try to redirect when she starts to argue about it. Here is an example of what I mean and what I actually used on my mother when she questioned my help: Mom: ""I can do this myself. I always have. Do you think I am stupid?"" Me: ""Of course not mom, I am helping you because you have always helped me and I'm only trying to pay back all those years of love you gave me. Won't you let me do this for you? Pretty please?"" 
What works on many people is if you turn around the ""help"" you offer to them-into helping YOU. I got my mother to move in with me and husband by telling her she would really be helping me if she came to live with us and cooked for us. She always loved to cook for her family. I told her we worked and hardly ever ate home cooked meals. She thought she could still cook, of course she could not, but in her mind she believed we needed her and not the other way around.

He sees several other doctors, but now we have 1 main doctor and they all can see the records and see what each doctor is doing. Because our spouse/parents/friends have a form of Dementia, they need special care, and because of that I have my husband seeing a Neurologist, and no I dont have insurance, so I pay out of pocket for everything. Please again my opinion, find 1 doctor who can ""manage"" his care and have the other doctors confer with the main doctor so that your spouse/parent/friend gets the best care for their needs, and not the  opinion of a doctor who only knows what he has been trained for...",0,1

My heart goes out to you. After my Dad passed, my oldest sister showed up at my mom and his home.  She took stuff that was verbally promised to my other sister and myself.

This is the sister who has seen our mother twice in 15years. 
  I would call the non-emergency number to the police. I would explain your fears and get their advice. I would ask about getting a restraining order against everyone of them.  This might be harsh, but they seem like the type that only severe measures will wake them up. 
 I would put new deadbolt locks on all the doors.  I would also get alarms for the windows, so if they try to open a window the alarm will go off.  I have known people who have put dowels in their windows, so they cannot be opened. They are inexpensive and are fairly easy to cut to fit snugly in the window to prevent the bottom window from being pushed up, or slid over.
After I did all of this, I think I would call the daughter that you get along with, the best. I would let her know you have informed the police and if your home is broken into, the family will be the first suspect. You may let her know you have spoken to the police regarding restraining orders, even if you can't get to. A threat may stop them in their tracks. 
Keep in touch and let us know how you are doing.

They have to make sure that no one is affected.  And all are well.
Norovirus is so contagious that even if your LO isn't affected you could be affected by visiting and then spread it on your next visit.  Or infect your LO.

6335.6,"One thing that someone else had used to get a reluctant LO to go was calling it a ""Club"" instead of senior center. If you took to calling it a ""Friendship Club"" or some other positive and suggestive title, maybe she won't be so reluctant. Using an optimistic sounding name might make it feel less like something she is doing against her will and instead something she could look forward to. It's not much, but it might help a little with her reluctance. And no, it's not necessary to tell her in advance that she's going again tomorrow. All she needs to know is that she's going today because she's unlikely to remember about it and nothing's gained or lost by not telling her longer in advance. If your mom could get in the habit of announcing to her in a cheery voice that today she ""gets to go to her Friendship Club!"" it might go over better than expecting a tug-of-war to get her out of the house.
Your mom or parents both should confer with an elder care attorney. Medicare is health insurance and Medicaid is coverage for people who can't afford self-pay whose income and assets are below a certain threshold level, which differs state to state.

38507.6,"I'm with Crushed. I have never heard of anyone getting SSDI without having been determined eligible. 
Rosepoint, 
Don't panic about applying. If you have good medical document to verify a disability, you should be okay. 
It was hard, but I convinced our son who has autism to apply for SSI when he turned 18. I had insisted that he have thorough neuropsych testing when he was 17. Social Security made him see a psychologist for a disability examination. It was a complete waste of governmental money. The doctor said that he read the report, he knew the neuropsychologist who wrote it, and there wasn't anything that he could add to it. He talked to us for a little while, gave my son a little lecture on personal hygiene, and that was it. His claim was approved, with the standard five month waiting period. 
My husband's case was similar. He had had two sets of neuropsychological testing. His application was approved and he started getting benefits five months following his retirement. There was a little glitch. The interviewer told me not to send in copies of my records. He said that they would request them from the doctors. Well, the first neuropsychologist never sent in a copy of his report. I found out that Social Security makes the request twice. If they don't get anything, they make their decision without that doctor's records. But they don't tell the applicant that they didn't get it. You have to keep on top of them. 
DH's application was denied weeks after he applied because all they had were a few office notes from his neurologist which only mentioned a tentative diagnosis of MCI. When I found out, I was a bit pissed off because I was specifically told not to send in any records. I went in person to our local SSA office and have them copies of EVERYTHING that I had. I request copies of all medical records. I scan them and save them on my computer. That way, I can print out all the copies that I want. I never mail out the originals. I appealed the denial immediately and sent in a stack of documents. DH was promptly approved and he got his first check right on time. 
So, in my opinion, that's the key: having lots of medical documentation. I even sent in some of his work records to show his decline in performance. If I hadn't convinced him to retire, they were going to force him out. He had 35 years in, so he gets full benefits. ",0,1

I'm in Michigan and not an attorney but I can tell you my experience and what my attorney said.

First of all you need to consult an attorney who specializes in elder law. A general practice attorney doesn't have the specialized knowledge you need.

I took out a home equity loan on my mother's house to help cover the cost when I placed her in Memory Care. I have conservatorship and guardianship so I had to have court approval. Do you have POA or conservatorship? I don't know if you can get a loan on her home without one of them, but an attorney can tell you.

Also, the government can't always force the sale of the house. I learned about ""Lady Bird Deeds"" on this forum and they are used in Michigan. I don't know about PA. They prevent the government from forcing the sale of the house to recoup the Medicaid payments made. The work by transferring the house directly to the heirs upon death. In many states they also protect the heirs from some taxes when the house is transferred. My attorney told me we can create the Lady Bird Deed when we apply for Medicaid for my mom - if we ever need to do that.

I understand your concerns - every month when I pay her bill, I look at the balance left on her loan and worry that it's not going to last. It's really stressful!

I hope that helps,

I ask because Rich and I just did one.  Since the Az, We started doing alot of paperwork that we were avoiding..   It did lead us to talking about it.  Rich said the same thing.  If it came to a feeding tube ""he said he does not want it"".  But I guess if you have PA..you can do it for him..
I just want you to know that I will be praying for your family as you go through this time.  I Just want your husband to be pain free, and have comfort. 
Wishing you well...

10481.96,"Thanks for an excellent discussion.  My DH has familial EOAD.  His mother died at 50 with AD and he was a caregiver for her.  He saw many of his aunts, uncles and cousins die of AD.  He completed his Advanced directive just before he left work at 50 and spoke about it with his doctor.  He stated in his form, he did not want any type of mechanical etc. intervention to keep him alive.  He told his doctor and me, if he contracted cancer or any other illness like it, he did not want to be treated. He always told me he would commit suicide if he inherited the AD mutation.  However, in the early stages, he became an active advocate for those with AD and found a lot of meaning in doing this work.  He asked me to kill him when he could no longer communicate and take care of himself.  I had to tell him I could not do this because I would go to jail.  He did not want to go through what he saw his mother go through and wanted to spare his own family the suffering.  Sadly, DH is now living out his worst nightmare.  He has been dx'd with AD for 13 years and is now 63.
We live in Oregon which has legalized physician assisted suicide.  The patient must be terminally ill with only six months to live, be able to communicate his wishes, and the patient must administer the lethal dose his self .  So as mentioned by prior responders, there lies the catch 22 with AD.
I have been reading about the controversy over euthanasia in the Netherlands and Belgium.  Since I am not as eloquent as many of you on this message, I am citing this article in which the authors discuss euthanasia in the Netherlands  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4929163/    ""The number of dementia patients requesting euthanasia in the Netherlands has increased over the past five years. The issue is highly controversial. In this contribution we discuss some of the main arguments: the nature of suffering, the voluntariness of the request and the role of the physician. We argue that society has a duty to care for patients who suffer from dementia and to make their lives as good and comfortable as possible. We also argue that it can be morally acceptable for those who do not want to continue their life with dementia to choose to die. The choice can be based on good reasons.""  They go on and discuss their position. 
I think it is important not to confuse AD with other mental or psychiatric disorders.  People with AD are on the slippery slope.  DH has no health issues other than AD.  His mother died of AD.  She showed symptoms at 44 and died when she could no longer swallow at 50.  My mother had dysphagia as a complication of severe rheumatoid arthritis.  Not being able to swallow is very anxiety provoking.  She was able to express this to me and my sister because she did not have dementia.  At my mother's last emergency visit  the doctors had my mother on a respirator.  My mother said she did not want to go through this anymore and did not want any intervention if she could not breathe on her own when she was taken off the respirator.  Her doctor came out and told us she was on the slippery slope and he recommended honoring her wishes.  She did get off the respirator but died a couple days later of pneumonia.  My MIL was not able to tell in words her wishes but her agitation, anxiety told the story that her life had became a hell on earth.  It is a terrible thing to watch and I feel very sad, conflicted and angry that we all have to endure this long drawn out death of the brain.  If I was not so consumed with caregiving and working fulltime, I would like to devote more time advocating for the broadening of physician assisted suicide to address terminal brain diseases like AD.

If your mom has dementia she likely has anosognosia.  This is a characteristic of dementia that causes some PWDs (person with dementia) to be unaware of having any difficulties.  She truly believes she is fine.  Also, some PWDs will have delusions and misconstrue things.  Please read several of the threads because your story is not unique.

  I found it such a maze to work through understanding the medical field in relationship to my father.  It's not easy understanding what drugs are beneficial and what are not.  It definitely seems like trial and error and what struck me most was what seemed the casualness of it.  I guess the medical professionals are sometimes as stumped as we are in knowing what is going to work.  If they are stumped, you sure don't have anything to feel bad about.  I would become frustrated and nervous when a doctor or nurse practitioner could not give me a straight answer and seemed as unsure as me.
  Don't worry about the staff liking you.  I worried about that, went out of my way not to ask for anything out of the ordinary, tried to be understanding and patient, overly so, but in the end, I should have pushed harder for my father and not have been so patient and not be the good-little-girl-who-didn't-make-a-fuss that I was brought up to be.  I'm not saying to be obnoxious and unrealistically demanding, but you must make it known that you are your mother's advocate and you have a deep caring for your mother and they will listen to you and answer your questions and respect your opinions and your questions.  You are an integral part in your mother's care.
  Do what you need to do for your mother.  You are not being paranoid, you are not being overly cautious.  You are being vigilant and that is exactly what your mother needs, someone who truly has her best interest at heart.
  The care staff will have other patients, they move on, they don't have the emotional investment and commitment you have to your mother.

The daycare my husband attended was run by the local hospital. It was $9.50 an hour with a lite breakfast and lunch served. . So an 8 hour day was around $80.00. They started at 7:30 in the morning and went till 5:30 pm (to accommodate the working crowd). My husband went from 9-4 three days a week so for us it was about $200 a week or $800 a month. We were private pay but they did have Medicaid clients and sliding scale clients. I don't know what they paid.
I never had an in home caregiver as that was my job. I'm a retired nurse. Around here, depending on the skill level (companion vs CNA, LPN vs RN) cost are between $15-45 an hour. Depends on what kind of ""care"" you LO needs. A companion might run errands and keep them entertained but would not do incontinence care and bathing. That would be a CNA.

He will often wake up in the middle of the night in a panic believing that we don't like him anymore and that we're planning to throw him out of the house.  My daughter, age 24, is his primary caregiver during the day.  You would think that he'd be extra cooperative with her but that's not the case.  He gives her a difficult time, gets frustrated, has hit her.  It's me that he's attached to and when I get home from work he'll go on and on about what great care I gave him throughout the day.
  The additional piece is that he really doesn't know who we are.  He thinks that I'm his girlfriend but then will ask me to call his girlfriend to let her know where he is at the moment.  He definitely does not remember his daughter, her name, and often thinks that she's a man. (My husband is blind.)  So, instead of remembering our daughter, he sees her as an interference and someone who gives him substandard care.

They told me they didn’t know but would call back. Called no return again. I thought it must be some The we need to talk in person serious maybe. Still didn’t know appointment was coming up. Guess I’ll find out when we get there. Doctor Walsh’s in and tells my mom that Cathy her daughter had called concerning mom being abused by me.

You need to keep on asking many questions based on what he says. As short questions and give him a long time to think.

We have been married 35 years, so I just make him what I know from habit something that he would eat. I try to carry on life as per usual..
I would think that depending upon the various stage and the behaviours of an angry spouse, that the suggestions of agreement & validation / changing the subject, etc. are better than trying to ask questions and delve into the angry behaviour, which would only exasperate the issues..
IMHO, the anger comes from nowhere, for little reason, or an imagined affront - who wants to spend any time and energy on that? We spouses are doing the best to our ability and stamina to deal with the physical attributes of the disease, we don't need to play mind games too.

I did not stress over it because it was something that had to happen. In time, my mother, who is in the severe stage of Alz, accepted this new person just fine. 
My suggestion is to train the caregiver to provide the type of care your mother is used to and let time make things right again. Try not to stress over it and when mother complains, be positive and let her see you treat the new caregiver with affection and familiarity.

My husband, 52, was diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease 2 years ago, which is basically like fast-acting dementia. No treatment, no cure. I'm 45, have stopped working and have been caring full-time for Phil for the past year. My daughter, Amy, 13, moved in with my mom around Thanksgiving because things became really stressful and scary. My husband was blaming her for things (he couldn't find files on the computer and would get really angry at her for ""moving"" them) and wouldn't believe her when she said she didn't do them... There was this weird jealousy thing going on. When I tried to help my daughter with homework or just laugh with her he would get really demanding or loud or angry- unfortunate stuff. This is before he was put on Quetiapine (anti-psychotic), but there were rages and the time he ran into the house wielding the ax, or the day he left the ax on her bed...
Now a days, my husband can't talk or understand speech much. He is still fully mobile! but incontinent both ways and highly confused much of the time. Did I mention that he doesn't sleep all night?
The latest is that my mom and Amy are having trouble communicating. My mom, 80, isn't great at understanding teens, never was, LOL. She acts neglected and resentful when Amy doesn't want to share details of her life. Amy says that when she does share, my mom tends to give her lectures or make Amy feel like she's doing something wrong. Yeah.
So, I'm looking into my next move. I've been getting more respite care hours so that I can spend time with Amy and my mom, but it's never enough. I feel like I need to bring Amy home. I've told her that by the start of the next school year she will be home and Phil will be... elsewhere.
I have a court petition in late April that is trying to have all of Phil's assets put into my name  so that he could qualify for MediCal. If this works, no guarantee, I will probably try to get him placed in a facility of some kind. Of course, I feel terrible. 
For all the difficulty, I still connect with Phil in simple ways - laughing over a mishap, making crazy faces together in the mirror, rubbing his back. It seems at least once a day we are both calm and we can look each other in the eyes and connect. He loves being home out in the country. But I am losing him. Month by month he is more withdrawn, or out of his logical mind.

Please get your rider checked to make sure the safety switch that will have the lawnmower die if you try to get off of it while the blades are still engaged.

My dh can no longer empty the dishwasher. He hasn't tried in at least 3 to4 years. I guess he cannot remember where they go. He is unable to tell me why he stopped doing it. I know I found dishes in weird spots. Then he wonders why I worry when he thinks he can do the farm work.

Three weekends ago he got a message from the choir director that they were going to have two weeks off then would sing that third Sunday. She specifically said to put the third Sunday on their calanders as she would probably not be able to send an email reminder. My dh swears he never saw the email. He almost acts like I am lying to him. Funny, when he looked at the calander choir was written in. He no longer seems able to deal with the calander at all. Yet he still thinks he can drive a car. Who understands how their minds work.

The school year is quickly coming to an end and they may be able to help direct you to some free camp or day activities for your kids. Knowing the situation “should” motivate them to help and to find more conservative consequences than suspensions. If you get nothing but “they need punishment and/or discipline” then let them know that’s not constructive or appropriate.

  ORMOND BEACH --   
A body found Thursday in a car submerged in a retention pond has been identified as a Volusia County woman missing since Monday.
Deputies said an autopsy performed Friday positively identified the victim as 79-year-old Rose Bruce.
The car was found Thursday afternoon in a pond near Hand Avenue and Williams Boulevard, near Ormond Beach.
A medical examiner's autopsy determined that Rose drowned.
  Bruce was first reported missing early Tuesday morning by her daughter-in-law, who returned home from work to find their house filled with smoke and dinner burning in the oven, but no sign of Bruce or her car.
  The Volusia County Sheriff's Office said there were no signs of foul play, and the wreck appeared to be a tragic accident.

Since you have already reached out to his PCP and the neurologist who sees him because of the hydrocephalus, maybe it's time to move on.

I would suggest seeking a university teaching hospital-based memory care clinic.

  We did eventually get the Medicare/Medi-Cal (Medicaid) mess straightened out by adding on a very small additional vision policy that kept my mother's account from sitting on the seesaw.
  I also learned in the meantime that Medi-Cal is indeed the secondary, not the primary, so Johanna was right (as usual - big smile). Additionally I learned that the Medi-Medi combination is good for catastrophic, for Part D meds, and for emergency treatment. But everything else is like pulling teeth without an anesthetic.
  Especially in California, where the Schwarzenegger legacy of ""privatized"" Medi-Cal administration still refuses to die. The headache I had described in other posts - where we have no gero-psych wards in this county, and our county's administrator (Gold Coast) doesn't play well with L.A. County's administrator (Healthcare Plans, something like that)... That drove me nuts to the bitter end.
  My mother died in April 2013. The last three weeks of her life, I was able to rescue her from a truly awful situation, one that involved Medicare fraud and organized crime. I've had the dickens of a time getting Medicare to move on stuff, although the case is being aggressively prosecuted by the L.A. County Sheriff's Department Major Crimes, the FBI, and the California DoJ.
  On my mother's birthday in December, a large news syndicate used my mother's story to illustrate the nightmare that is Medicare fraud and organized crime. I am happy to report that as a direct result of that article (actually part of a bigger series), Medicare is using my mother's case to review their processes. Hopefully they will be able to figure out how and why the system fails (why it is that these crooks are being prosecuted, yet United Healthcare and Medicare still have not processed the ""credits"" and tried to retrieve some of the money they paid out).

Welcome pandemonium, I agree with Marta that if you weren’t at the doctor appts, you may not be getting the whole story. First a disclaimer, I have no medical training so can only speak from my own experience. Alzheimer’s is only one of many many dementias and each person is unique. My husband’s dementia is believed to originate from a severe brain injury but no one knows for sure. Although he had problems for some time the first really big red flag was acute separation anxiety. He too had struggled with anxiety most of his life, but this was different.  Some dementias do not have the same acute short term memory loss as is typically associated with alz.

16187.6,"Hello there again; I just responded to your other thread, so we are now on Part 2! You have had such a set of challenges on your hands, and having been in similar situations and being my mother's advocate, I surely do understand how frustrating and very concerning this can be. It's not only a matter of all things practical, it is also a matter of the heart. Hang in there, there is a better way for you to go around this.
First; since this self-directed approach has been failing, it will not be of much help for you to continue to try and get this handled in an easy manner between yourself and staff; at this point, that is rather like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall. And let's be totally up front. You are consistently an uber-advocate on your mother's behalf and have been for all the time she has been in residence in that facility. By now, the involved staff may be not ""hearing"" you as clearly. They may be a bit jaded and this is something that will need a bit of finessing. The involved staff may also have an element of bias and a different understanding of what is actually happening from what your understanding and feelings are.
The one sure way to accomplish what you are wanting to have done, (and this is reasonable - you are leaving no stone unturned), is to contact the physician and ask him/her to PLEASE call and order a NEW and COMPLETE PT and OT assessment and plan of care. Have him also request a written evaluation be sent to him when the assessment is completed. If you want to be present while the eval is being done, I strongly suggest that you stay out of the line of sight of your mother so as not to affect her performance during the testing; that can happen.
The PT/OT Department cannot do anything but comply as it is a physician's order.
In the vast majority of care facilities, the movement has been to have contracted PT/OT rather than having them be their own staff members; the cost savings is significant to handle PT/OT in that manner. They also do not have the headaches they would have with scheduling and staff matters.
NOTE: You asked about taking your mother outside for an eval. I personally would not do this. It would be stressful for your mother and it would be a taxing effort for her on several levels to have to be transferred and then feel threatened by all the unfamiliar stimuli which would then in turn undoubtedly affect how she performs and you would have an inaccurate assessment of her abilities.
If you have no confidence in the NH PT/OT staff's expertise, that is another matter. If they seem technically competent but you have a personality conflict with them, that is one thing; but if you feel they not only conflict with you, but that their expertise is not up to snuff, then you can ask about an outside entity coming in and assessing your mother.
But this too also can cause some drift in the outcome. The NH will need to know the person is adequately licensed and qualified to come in to see their patient; do they have other PT organizations that have been credentialed and authorized to come into their facility that you could use? A new and outside person may not have a grasp on dementia and on your mother's historical background. What is written in the record may be anemic, and it may also not demonstrate the day to day actualities. This call will be up to you. Personally, I would not want to complicate anything more than I had to as things are already pretty well complex. However; I am not there and you are.
The fact that your mother has a two person assist is actually very good. It will NOT keep her from moving on her own or declining further. Believe me, the NH doesn't do two person transfers lightly; it affects staffing. They do it when they have identified a real risk/problem. A one person transfer at this juncture leaves your mother at high risk for falls and fractures; it also leaves the poor staff trying to help her at high risk for their own injury which will affect their own physical condition and take then out of their job for a period of time and affect their incomes. You cannot expect that from either your mother or staff, so this is one item you probably need to think about letting go of.
A two person transfer keeps both your mother and the staff much safer and is completely appropriate. It will NOT keep your mother from doing things for herself. It's all about safety. If they did not do this and your mother fell, then you would feel upset they did not take extra precautions. Err on the side of safety, you will not be sorry.
I also feel that it is true that it would be good to remember that dementia progresses and it also affects the LO's physical capabilities as the damage to the brain progresses. It will happen; it is an absolute and none of us can escape that. That does not mean that you should not continue being the loving advocate you are; but it would also be good to remember the outcomes as we travel this path.
Perhaps you will find that with a bit of med adjustment as you address in your other post and perhaps with a bit of PT/OT work, your mother may have a bit of improvement; but this is going to take tincture of time and slow adjustment and that should give you more insight in the realities that are truly present.

25081.29,"My mom is one of those that Iris mentions, that has anosognosia. She developed it after a hemorrhagic stroke to her parietal lobe that left her otherwise unimpaired. 

Her dementia had its start years before the stroke, and in retrospect, she had definitely exhibited memory impairment symptoms, and even got lost while driving, but never told anyone. How I wish she had been diagnosed, then, prior to the anosognosia, because though she would not have liked it (who would), I think she would have been able to accept it and perhaps even start making plans for herself.


Right now, I have made the unilateral decision not to tell her. I strongly believe that she already knows very well something is not right with her, and occasionally she will admit to having ""senior moments."" But after she ""failed"" a cognitive test in her doctor's office (and knew it then, I suspect), later that week, she accused the doctor of having committed improprieties against her and said she didn't want to go back to him. 


Just based on that incident, I think telling my mom at this point would only introduce more chaos into a life that can't accommodate it. I hate withholding the info, but don't know what other course to take. She would suspect any doctor who told her about the diagnosis. So, I agree very much that there is no one right answer.",0,1

  Please don't beat yourself up, please believe in your heart that you did everything possible to take care of your mom and protect her while she was in trouble.  We have no control over the medical profession and if they will do the right thing.  I watched over my mother very carefully for 6 years and I found out after she died that she actually died from a ""BAD DRUG"" that caused her to bleed internally which resulted in her death. 
  I had no knowledge of this bad drug and believed that I was very efficient in taking care of her and I trusted the medical profession to take care of her as I stood by her side.  The drug she was given was Predaxa - a very deadly drug for elderly people that causes internal bleeding.  She was given this drug while in the hospital for an irregular heartbeat.  She did not have a heart attack or any event that would cause here to die, she simply had an irregular heartbeat. 
  If they had not given her this drug, she would still be alive today.  So, we can only do so much to protect our loved ones but sometimes, there are things behind the curtain, that we are ""unaware"" of.  You were a wonderful daughter to your mom.

33307.26,"Hi Toni, it is good to hear that Ken is improving somewhat and that the wound care specialist is on his case and monitoring things for that purpose; I am sorry for the severity of the level of his pain especially on rising; that has to be awful for him.  I am also glad to hear that you are able to get a bit more sleep since he is in the care center.  That is golden to get catch up a bit of good sleep.  So your brother is coming in from Florida; that too is good news.  I hope all goes well with your son and his heart cath.  Keep us posted, we will be thinking of you and all that is going on.
Lorita, the photos are delightful.  June is such a pretty little calf; and the photos of the little ones meeting up and checking each other out is adorable.  Really fun to see them all playing and rollicking together, I'll bet.
Gosh; your niece.  How long has it been seen you have actually seen her in person and seen her in her home?   If she has large bags of tube feed, usually there is an electric pump to go with it so it goes in at a certain set rate over a certain level of time.  It can cause some serious problems if things are infused too quickly and it is contraindicated for her to do so.
 Do you feel confident that she is able to take care of herself; manage the timing and amount of feedings, keep her hygiene acceptable, and the house reasonable for health purposes, to take her meds on time and in a manner in which they were prescribed, and can she take adquate care of the dogs who also need attention and feeding.  This is undoubtedly hard to assess at a distance.  If you have a POA that is helpful; if you could get her to sign a HIPAA Waiver, that would be optimal for gaining information.  If Home Health is coming in, perhaps they can have their Social Worker drop by or use the RN to have her sign a Waiver and then get them to mail you a copy so you have it on hand if your niece is willing to sign it.
 Not good for you to try and get there in person, from what you said, it would be a 300 mile round trip, flooding across areas as well as  uncertain weather and roads; and you have all the daily care for the animals to tend to from cattle to dogs to cats and if I recall correctlly, another new calf is due.
 Since Todd is no longer in the picture, I wondered if she might still be on friendly terms with one of her two ex-husbands; if she is, perhaps if they live near, one of them could look in on her.
I know that I am entering into a lot of words about this; but I have seen SO many patients in similar situations over years, that there is an uncomfortable feeling for what may be going on.   You have no way to know if you are receiving honest input from your LO or if you are not and how things are really going; that makes deducing matters very difficult.  Both strong physical issues as well as emotional ones seem present; sure wish they would have kept her longer or transferred her to a few more weeks of care at a step-down rehab center. 
I am sorry I cannot be there for you, we sure do live a long distance from one another.  I know Judith tried to see her, but could not access the facility due to construction.
 If you feel she is in real danger, especially if Home Health is not going in or if she does not open the door for them, one option would be to contact APS in her county and ask them about what they do, and if you are comfortable, having them go out to do an assessment and cheek out how things are going.  Not optimal, but there is significant risk on multiple levels.   I know you said that your niece is best to be at home, but from what has been happening in an ongoing manner, that seems to be becoming rather shaky at this point in time.
Do you know if she went back to the hospital today as she said she was going to do?  I hope so, and I hope they are able to be more helpful, even sending her to rehab for a period of time to stabilize and strengthen even more if she does not fit criteria for readmission.
 NOTE:  Patsy was misunderstanding.  California Medi-Cal does NOT give only a certain number of hospital days and then discharge the patient at the end of the days.  Same thing in Oklahoma with SoonerCare and Medicaid; they do NOT give only a certain number of hospital days and then the person needs to leave.  All acute hospital stays are based solely on medical necessity for length of stay for care to continue at the acute hospital level.  That is the law from states, the feds and the oversight accrediting bodies such as JCAHO, and state oversight as well as the state Insurance Commissioners. 
 There is some coding for both Medicare and Medicaid for billing reimbursement and data purposes and primary diagnoses usually have a number of days attached to each diagnosis for average length of stay; BUT this is NOT for patient care use.  Again, the key to all is based on medical necessity for the level of care.  Sometimes that level of care can be met in rehab, or a NH, or at home with an aide for family caregiver, or Hospice or Home Health.
 It will be important to know how Sarah came to be discharged, and what she told the doctor and case manager about the level of help she had at home.  Has she clearly stated just who actually did drive her home?   So hope that the care manager/discharge planner got an order for Home Health visits and that they have begun. 
 Okay; enough of that before I cause your eyes to glaze over if they have not already done so. 
 I was hoping to see a new Post from Lady Peewee as to how she and her husband are doing since they had to evacuate once again, but nothing yet.  She is so worried about losing her job.  Don't know where she and Peewee are staying, she has not said.  This morning on the news, it showed the water continuing to rise and more rain to come.  Unbelievable.  My heart goes out to all those people.  It is so hard when this must be done at all; but when one has an ill LO or a LO with dementia, it sure does ramp up the stress.
 Gosh I am hungry today; don't know why, I just am.  Good thing I'm upstairs right now and have some stuff to do up here.  I got the new extra-firm high loft pillows I ordered some time ago. There was a delay in getting them.  They are sure difficult to put inside a king size pillow case; they are large and I had to wrestle them. I will try them out tonight and see how they do.  Since I am like you, Lorita and Sara, I like to sleep a bit propped up so I do not get vertigo when I rise.  The old pillows are so old and flat and probably not the best things to be sleeping on.  I shall find out tonight how everything works.
Best be making tracks and looking in on some other stuff; I so hope all begins to improve with your niece soon Lorita; I know that as it does, it will put your mind at ease.  Say hello to Miss June for me and tell her I think she is very pretty.  So is her mother.

43199.1,"Bob is spot on regarding the, ""ruling out"" business.  I drove myself to distraction trying to get a diagnosis or reason why things were happening the way they were.
  Initially, the Geriatrician diagnosed Alzheimer's Disease after everything else was ruled out.  Several MRIs showed nothing, and that is not unusual.  Aricept was initiated, and the behaviors went through the roof.  Had to stop the med. 
  I had already been researching and searching and reading everything I could about AD.  But, symptoms did not always seem to fit quite on center.
  Finally got to a very excellent Neurologist who reassessed and stated he thought it was one of the FrontoTemporal Dementias rather than AD.  Later, a SPECT Scan showed the damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.  Bingo!
  I know this will sound odd; but it was SUCH a huge relief to know the name of what we were facing.  At least I knew what ""country"" we were in.  Not knowing was like being parachuted into a foreign land on a secret mission and no one would tell me what country; I did not have a map, did not speak the language, and no one had told me where I was supposed to go and what I was supposed to do.
  Having that diagnosis began to provide the basics I needed to begin to move forward. And; in FTD, Aricept is contraindicated.  From that point onward, only the dementia expert was permitted to prescribe and manage the dementia; the Geriatrician managed the physical illnesses or problems that arose.  For us, that made the ""best practice"" team and put us in good stead for all the complexities that unexpectedly arose while on our journey.
  Hang in there, and once you hear what the exams had to say, then it will put things in a more clear perspective.  Not what any of us wanted to have happen, that's for sure.
  I am so glad you dropped by to let us know how you are and how things are going.

47318.8,"Hi,
  It may be more difficult for a man to give up his license and quit driving due to dementia.  Maybe a macho thing....I really do not know.
  My wife has had to accidents that totally 2 cars in the last several years.  She has gotten lost while driving.  My son and I have tried to avoid the issue by driving my wife everywhere.  This worked in an informal way.  Then we took her car key off her house key chain and she really did not notice.
  After we got a complete workup with PET scan, MRIs, etc the neurologist notified the DMV and they suspended her license.  She initially said she would appeal the ruling, but she has done nothing to do this.
  She has accepted this condition, and my son and I are always available to take her anywhere....so she is Ok.  My next tricky step is to try to get her to let me sell her auto.  Out of sight....out of mind.
  Driving is independence...so it is hard to accept this change.  But there are so many reports of seniors with dementia who have gotten into accidents and hurt or killed bystanders.  So, the family has to be aggressive and proactive.

  Sprited? I am now. But my long and destructive journey thru the first 7 years of my wife's Alzheimer gave me the greater part of my experience and thicker skin. At the end point of that 7 years I would have welcomed my departure from this earth. Then I realized I had pulled myself out of deep emotional problems magnified by my war (all us guys have had at least ""our"" war). So I applied the same remedies and accepted or brought myself up to the surface on most of the remaining chinks in my armor. My ""heal"" and candid realization about Alzheimer was spread out before me during all 9 years, with my last two years being on the offense, vice the defense. Co-mixing with my wife's patients and also watching employee Caregivers handle Demented patients not daily, but rather many times each day, and each employee Caregiver keeping not only a balanced mind, but finding time to become friends with the patients and enjoy the humor the patients never seem to not cease presenting.
  Currently my wife does things that re-ignights my hurt feelings, but I am now more a survivor with lots of experience, rather than a new recruit to the world of Alzheimer and Dementia.
  I recall the time approx in my 5th year when I still had my wife at home. We were sitting next to each other in our chairs and I noticed we had not spoken to each other for 20 minutes. I felt no guilt and told myself to enjoy the silence. That, jenm, is called being experienced. I soon placed my wife and my heart broke completely. The depression and stress, living alone without those that called me a realative heretofore, plunged me into the darkest depths that most could not experience. Now that I have been thru all phases of Alzheimer care except applying for Medicaid I can with some confidence be objective with Newbies whom need an objective guiding hand with their ongoing lives.",0,1
28198.7,"I believe that one thing that is so frightening to a person with dementia is the sense that time and the structure of their lives are missing. There is disorganization, which can be very disorienting, both for them and their caregivers.It may help to impose some structure on your MIL's life, so that she becomes comfortable with a schedule. This is easier said than done, I know. Some simple things you might try is to have her breakfast and medicines at the same time each morning, then let her do the dishes. After that, maybe there is a TV show she likes, and she will come to understand that you work while she watches the show. Keep her reassured that she is safe and loved. Simple reassurances, such as ""You're going to be just fine"" take so little time, but go a long way when there is fear and uncertainty.

Who takes care of your MIL while you work? You may be able to structure her schedule so it mirrors yours. Structure, order, and a sense of purpose help to keep the mind oriented, even in people without dementia. I hope you can find a way to help to structure your MIL's life.

My father had tricks dealing with his dementia. He got up at the same time pretty much, read the headlines, had his coffee and breakfast, worked his crossword, made lots and lots of lists. He kept stand-up cards that had the day of the week and the date. He was so good at keeping himself ordered that we didn't know how severe his dementia was until he died.

My mother is just the opposite and she lives in sickness and fear. She has never been an orderly person, so structuring her time is like trying to turn a swamp into a water park. I impose a little structure, but haven't figured out anything meaningful yet.

Since your MIL is shadowing you, I have a feeling that she is seeking structure, so you'll probably have better luck with her than I do my mother. I believe that knowing what she is going to do and what to expect will help provide that sense of security she may be seeking. In a way, you are blessed, though you feel cursed at times. Your MIL has bonded with you and thinks that you're the best thing since apple pie. Quite a compliment to have her trust you so much.",1,1
14293.12,"I've had the drugs explained similarly, that they are effective for a time, we don't always know which period of time, or if a person would have declined even more without them, and that the time to go off them varies by each person's circumstances. Sometimes as people get more advanced you don't want to prolong things (like a hospice end of life situation.) Of course some folks' side effects may be bothersome enough to quit, and sometimes people get to the point that they are on so many other drugs like anti anxiety/depressants, antipsychotics, or drugs for other health problems that it makes sense to downsize the drug list and interactions. A few people at my local Alz support group have gotten to the point where the memory care psychiatrist has their LO on so many drugs that they can't tell what's helping, what's causing what negative thing, and they say enough! and end all drugs except ones for diabetes, blood pressure etc. I'm surprised they took him off Aricept and Namenda if he is still taking care of his personal hygiene, mobile etc. I thought that was generally the time the drug was likely being useful.",0,1

I would drop in at 7:00pm and mom would be sleeping. Pill box was off. I would get emergency calls that she ran out of pills and she had some explanation about BCBS can't refill a prescription until you were totally out. Dent on the car that she refused to talk about. Took a call from her home from a scammer that said they were her grandchild. Learned she let strangers into her home. I could go on and on. I saw a dementia class in the newspaper at a local care community. It was a couple hours for three weeks. The amount of resources I got in those sessions was invaluable (list of docs, attorneys, social workers, day care facilities, mc's, veteran's aid, and on and on). I also cried and people there understood. After the class, I knew I had to get out of the ""scrambling day to day"" and come up with a long-term plan. In the midst of carrying out the plan for a paid caregiver to come in several times a week, I got a bad cold. Long story short, being away for several days led to big problems and pretty quickly mc. I would encourage you to learn all you can about this illness and make a long-term plan. You are going to get a cold, you are going to need to go out of town, you are going to need to focus intensely on work at times, and there are times you simply will not be available.

I was a cook and she was a techie.    But we shared a burning ambition to create things.  I was an ideas person and she was a maker and builder of wonderful complicated things.She could sweat pipe better than I could. She was a genius with computers.
All I can say is that I knew she was special from the beginning.  I can still sit in the spot where I first kissed her in this house in 1972.  She was badly dressed, had no small talk, hated makeup  and thought of guys as  a different species of dubious value .  (Well not THAT  bad)
By Christmas of 1972 she agreed to marry me, but not for another 2 1/2 years.  She was 20 and my own Princess.

23852.4,"Dad lived with me 12 years.  He has numerous health issues - his entire endocrine system is under attack by his immune system.  So he has Diabetes, Addison's Disease, Hypothyroidism, and alot more. 
  The Addison's disease throws off blood glucose levels, and the medication for it does the same, so his diabetes is extremely unstable.  The dementia reached the point that Dad could not say, ""I don't feel well,"" ""I'm getting hot,"" ""I'm sweating.""  So he has to have eyes on him at all times.  He needs nursing care 24 /7 as someone has to be able to adjust his insulin when his blood glucose runs high, and has to give him orange juice, glucose tablets and other items when his blood glucose runs low.
  Family members are allowed to do these adjustments.  But a Home Health Aide can not, nor can a CNA.  So we reached a point where we needed a nurse here at home 24/7, which is not feasible for us.  There is just me here (plus dogs and cats, lol), I need to be able to sleep, go for groceries, etc.  So the placement was forced on us by the disease(s), not really a choice.

25072.12,"Nicole and sabob,
I'm in the same situation.  Dad cared for Mom all their marriage (she had mental illness that erupted shortly after they married and I was adopted).  Dad died last April.  I'm the only child.
  Mom is living with us.  She doesn't ask to go home--she knows that we rented their house out after Dad died, she never asked to go back.  For a while, she was in an independent senior apt, but she went downhill quick and ended up hospitalized and then to a nursing home, actually for ""rehab.""  She refused to work with the OT and PT, so the nursing home discharged her and I had no choice but to bring her home with us. 
  She's continuing to decline.  I have no idea how long she had been displaying signs of dementia--Dad was good at hiding it and would only come over or let us come over when Mom was having a ""good"" day, but I was used to that because of the MI--sometimes she could be just impossible and hateful.  I didn't think anything of it, just thought it was Mom being Mom until Dad got sick and I had to take over.  She was totally dependent upon him.  I suspect now that he got so sick so quick because he was so run down from running after her every whim--she has never had empathy and this disease just makes that worse.  I knew Dad was not worried about dying, but worried about what would happen to Mom, so I just kept promising him I would take care of her.  I intend to keep my promise, but I realize she may not be able to remain with us until the end.  I just spent the better part of the afternoon ""helping"" her poo.  I'm willing to do whatever I have to do, but there is a limit to my abilities and knowledge--I'm not a nurse or doctor. 
  I think you've gotten some good advice, sabob, about how to handle your Mom wanting to come home.  Talk to the nurses and see if she talks of going home when you aren't there and if you are a trigger, the best thing for her might be to reduce visits.  It's all about what is best for them and sometimes less of us is best for them and is not just us being selfish.  Hang in there.  I'm sorry for both of your losses, sabob and Nicole.

Correct, very much so.
My first funeral for one of my wife's co-patients was a little woman who was born tiny, oxygen starvation. At death she was approx. 3 feet long (never stood), and communicated with a vocal honking noise. When I voluntarily  attended the funeral of this tiny person, there was only 4 persons attending, including me. With my thought about ""Everyone has the right to be said goodbye to"" I gained many points with Staff at the Care Facility.
Since then I have been part of those whom pass away and are buried locally. I keep a photo of ""Lulu"", who at just prior the end was a near lunatic, but being absent of NOK her friends of many years put on a full fledge ""Salute and Goodbye"" to ""Lulu"". This demonstrative episode reflects what Alzheimer can do to even the most respected and productive pre-Alzheimer patient. ""Lulu"" in real life had been an admired teacher, author, painter, wife, and a widow of some 30+ years. ""Lulu's"" history told me that no one is immune to the ravages that Alzheimer can do to even the most respected and productive persons.

  I thankfully do not have sibling rivalry, but talk to many other caregivers that do, or parents that have NO help from any of their children!  How awful. 
  I do the most with mom (I am 1 of 4 children 2 boys, 2 girls), but ask for help whenever possible from the others.
  My opinion is that some family members are in denial of parent having this disease, or are afraid of themselves getting it, or don't want to think of their parent getting old and needing their help, or are scared/embarrassed to be with parent alone..
  I guess I could come up with a few more reasons too, but the reason I want to take care of mom and dad is that I feel it is time I gave back to them for all the years they cared for me and stood by me. And thankfully I have a wonderful husband that lets me spend a lot of time with them.

She would not have remembered anyway and there was no reason to get her anxious.  I believe I called once and she may have called me 2 or 3 times.  Her AL community would give her the phone when they couldn't redirect her.
I recall using fiblets while I was gone.  Told her I would be by ""soon.""  Often said I would talk to her ""later.""  I may have even shared with her when we all went boating or something to that effect.  My mom just wanted to talk to me so I do not think she was clinging to where I was or me being gone.  In fact, I recall she may have even been happy we all were together.  I have a strange sensation of being on the balcony talking to her, but I do not recall stress or anything negative from her.  Some of the more stressful times in the past are sort of etched in my mind and this trip wasn't one of them.

We should never treat them as kids, but their abilities and levels of functioning are so low in the mid to late stages that many of these items are appropriate and can provide hours of fun. (I used to love doing these things with my patients)  Also, puzzles with large pieces.
Another fun activity is popping corn. (With supervision of course). It's great if you have a popper because the noise, smell and sight of popping corn is great stimulation and fun for the person with AD. We always had a popper on our dementia units and had many games associated with popcorn.

She often doesn't even realize she's had a bowel movement.  When that happens, she leaves feces on chairs, her bed, etc.   The nursing home told her that it was unhygienic and could risk getting others sick.  She just stared at them with her jaw set in anger.
 I told her that using the disposables would only be temporary while she is transitioned off the medicine responsible for the diarrhea.  No dice. 
I replaced all her underwear with the disposables so she had no choice but to wear them.  Ha!  She chose not to wear anything under her pants rather than use the disposables.
It's taking a little longer than expected to get her off the medicine causing the diarrhea, but it will be a relief when she is no longer fecal incontinent.

  There are similarities between all the dementias, in that you lose the person bit by bit, piece by piece.  There are differences.  For the most part, VAD patients do not wander so that is something you do not need to worry about.
  I did find Dad would be at a level, then have a drop, then plateau at that level, then have a drop, etc., in his memory and cognitive functions.  I would see him start to forget something for a few days and then it was gone.  Almost like a light flickering and trying to stay on, but losing the battle and it goes out.  So one morning he could not remember how to use the microwave and I could talk him through it (from another room) that afternoon he was OK with it.  The next morning he may remember some of it then get stuck, that afternoon he was not sure.  By the 3rd morning, he had no clue what to do it was totally gone.  Some things went quick like that, 3 days, some things the 'flickering' lasted a week or so.  But I'd know, that was the next thing he was going to forget, lose the ability to do himself.

This may be another downturn we are experiencing. He is back to treating me as if I am the enemy. Never a talker, now it is even more rare for him to divulge anything about his health or moods...anything.
Our first emergency and alert came back in April when he announced he was going to drive himself from here to Austin down I35 (driving it is like a suicide mission). He wanted to re-connect with old high school friends. We put that issue to rest, but I had to guilt him into not going by saying I was concerned about his safety. I told him I was most perplexed about him not caring about my feelings — this is so unlike him.
Well, the issue is BACK. He is planning to drive down there AGAIN! What is this about? We are going to have to ARGUE again! Last time left us with many battle scars, it seems.
This time he is again behaving in a furtive way, as if I am his prison guard. I am ready to throw my hands up in the air and just let him go. At least he is planning to fly to Austin with only a short drive after. If he can plan all of this out, I will be quite surprised.",0,1

  If it's not a UTI withholding liquids late in the evening might help some.
  I worked for a urologist for years and it's very common for a man to have an enlarged prostate when they get older.  The only treatment I know of to completely correct the problem is a transurethral prostatic resection.  They go through the urethra and trim the prostate to enable them to urinate more easily.   You'll need to check with a urologist to be sure that's what it is.  PCP can do the prostatic exam and probably be able to determine if it's benign prostatic hypertrophy or something else but a urologist would have to do the surgery.

I agree with everything that has been posted above.

He must have a dx of EOAD to receive Compassionate Allowance for EOAD.

If his dx is EOAD, why is he not receiving Aricept or Exelon? Antidepressants alone won't help him.

I have been on Exelon patch and Namenda for 6 years as of this month, from May 2009. My memory and cognition are BETTER than they were in 2009. Not the way they used to be when I was at my peak, but better. I can do math again.
(Yea!)

He may be friends with his boss, but his boss has certain aspects that he is concerned with, such as his insurance claims. It is probably better for his boss if he is fired or retired, than on disability. But it is better for the patient to go out on disability. Be forewarned--there may be a conflict.

27499.2,"This is always a difficult subject to broach with our loved ones. Many have felt like what you said in your last statement.
  There are some things you might want to consider doing before approaching your grandfather. Maybe you have done these already.
  First, read and learn all you can about dementia. People with dementia have had their ""reasoner"" broken, and don't always see things in the same light as we do. There are people who are aware of their condition and are able to make decisions and prepare for the future, but from what you describe, it sounds like your Grandfather is not in that category. You can google Understanding the Dementia Experience by Jennifer Ghent-Fuller, for starters. It will help you immensely. I had trouble posting the link but I do have it saved on my computer and it can be printed out.
  Second, are there any family members other than your mom and aunt, whom you can talk to about Grandfather? If you know who his primary doctor or other medical professional is, you can contact that person or clinic and inform them of your concerns.
  I'd be concerned about him handling his own finances. Many people with dementia are masters at fooling people. If he is not able to manage many other areas of his life, then chances are that he really is not managing his money, medications or other things that ""seem"" to be under control. You or another trusted person should get financial power of attorney. I have durable power of attorney and it's saved my mom from going under financially.  Medical power of attorney is also recommended. Many people have sought the advice of an elder care attorney for these issues.
  I can relate to much of what you described. Having a conversation with my mom is a lot like talking to Foghorn Leghorn. There are a lot of ""you, uh, you uh"" and ""Um, uh, um""--a lot of halting, searching for the right word. My mom is, according to the scale, in stage 4 also but she has pieces of stages 5 and 6. These stages overlap sometimes and the lines between them can be blurred.

Please make a list of what needs to be done and slowly check them off your list. If you have something in writing, you will not need to think about what needs to be done but can just go through them and do them.

First on the list would be to call the local agencies that deal with seniors and get their list of resources. The first thing I did was put in a call to our local hospital's ALZ social worker. We set up an appointment and she told my husband and I what to expect, books to read, help and services available in out area, etc! I got in the loop for workshops and newsletters from the ALZ ASSoc. I got free brochures from the Fed government. All these things helped me prepare and made me feel more in control. It takes time to do this so give yourself a break as often as you can. Get others to help with some of the chores-like getting online to get the gov brochures or other free info.

Make time for yourself, too. Go on walks, see a friend, watch an uplifting movie. Make an appt to see a doctor to address any emotional, mental or physical issues. You need a deep reserve of calm and wellness to deal with a loved one with a chronic illness. But you can do it-many people have done the same.

All her friends are dead so it was not a concern that friends would stop visiting or caring.

The first 3 estimates I got were between $5500 and $7000 and none of them told me they would have filed the insurance for me until I told them I was going with the company I did.

The roofer called Allstate and filed the claim with us from our home, he went on the roof with the Agent so my husband or I didn't have to and the company did the repair work inside to the kitchen ceiling, too, which was also covered by the insurance due to the leak/water damage from roof.",1,1

I just want to echo what a couple of the others have said- you should get your finances in order ASAP. Maybe even start trying to get some things in your name now, even if you have to be a little sneaky? You want to be sure that your financial situation and credit is okay further down the road.
I had a LOT of trouble getting my husband to go to the lawyer with me, he finally only agreed when I told him we were both setting up for each other to be beneficiaries, executors, POA, etc. Of course, I knew full well he would never be able to fulfill any of that, I put down my daughter as an alternate and he was okay with all that.

It will be 3 years next month for me and I am still not back to normal. I became a night owl taking care of my mom and I still cannot go to bed before midnight or 1 am.

34218.2,"Dear Sir,  You have definitely come to the right place to receive a variety of ideas and sound advice regarding care for your LO.  Hang in there!  It does get better and like everyone here, we have all gone through the ""deer in the headlight"" look and overwhelming journey of just getting started.  I have been taking 24/7 care of my LO for nearly 5 years now who has LOAD, FTD, and other complications from Type II diabetes.  Medications are vital just to maintian stability. I recommend two reading resources to start with.  First is a book titled ""The 36 Hour Day"", and second book is titled ""A loving Approach To Dementia Care"" authored by Laura Wayman.  The second book is now my bible and offers such dynamic insight into how to work with and handle issues that arise with those who have dementia issues.  I respectfully disagree with the one response that it is to late to begin taking control of your DW's medications.  It can be done and she is fully able to respond right now to ""sound muscle memory learning techniques"" but it does take time and lots of practice, patience, and love to make it work.  It may not ever be perfect but it can sure be better.  With my LO, we set the boundaries as best we could when we first began but through trial and error, have managed to become her careprovider first, and being a supportive LO is a close second.  My LO now often times does not know my name but knows that I am a care provider and feels safe and comfortable that she is not alone and being taken care of.  My LO is now between stages 5 and 6 and leaning more into stage 6 right now.  But we started right where you are at now, took almost a year of hard work and learned muscle memory and it has all been so worth that hard work and effort.

15616.18,"Please accept my condolences on the loss of your mother. I am relatively new to this disease but over the last year have learned more than I ever want to know about it.

Moved Mom into MC last month and for now, she is the happiest I've seen her in a long time. Removing the stress of trying to live on her own seems to have given her some peace and she is greatly tuned into the routine of MC...even to the point of telling us it's time to leave when she has a meal or activity coming up...it's good to see her relax.

I did however, just finish cleaning out her home of 25 years and found many notes that Mom apparently wrote to herself over the past several years. In one instance, she had an old leather bill fold with a dozen envelopes inside, each one named for a particular bill. She used to keep her money in them for her budget. When I opened it, I found a note in her handwriting when it was still legible....'there isn't any money in here so stop looking. I hope you have $30.00 put aside somewhere else in case you need it.'

Although I laughed when I read it, tears soon followed. It seems Mom found herself dealing with memory and repetitive behaviors long before any of us were aware there was something wrong. But, of course she noticed. My mom was a bright woman who raised and supported three kids on her own and by the time we noticed things were not right with her, she was angry, paranoid and too far gone to hide it anymore.

10112.5,"First of all, very few people reach adulthood without lying.  Indeed, I will bet you that pretty much every time someone says, ""hi, how are you?"" you respond, ""I'm fine.""  <--- which often is a LIE. 
When you boss asks what you think of their new ugly shirt....I will BET you that you are NOT ""brutally honest.""  ""Meh""...is an appropriate response, and is not a lie...and also is NOT ""brutally honest.""  Indeed, pretty much NO human makes it far in adulthood being ""brutally honest.""
And we all lie our kids about Santa Claus and Easter Bunny. 
The arguments on this board where they mean and cruel with their brutal honesty (which abusive) or lie all the time about everything as a ""method"" care us....is insane, literally.  NO HUMAN acts like that in the REAL world.  So throw it all out trash bag where it belong....and go back, the basics.
WHO are you as a person?  WHAT are YOUR values?  HOW do YOU want in caring your loved one?  Because literally, you get decide....you get write the script how you going care your loved one.  And you should ALWAYS go with your gut instinct.
Indeed, we choose who we are as mothers and fathers, as sons and daughters, as husband or wife, as adults in the world - we CHOOSE what kind of people we going be.  This no different.  We get CHOOSE what kind of carer we going be our loved one. 
As they become vulnerable and dependent....the sanctity their heart and soul and personhood is placed in YOUR hands....it an awesome honor. 
Also, just because 30 people out of 500 on here might believe in lying...and the only ones posting on it...do no mean all the rest do.  So consider that as well.
Instead, USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT....like a normal, rational, reasonable adult would. 
After all....you will have keep looking at yourself in the mirror for the rest of your life
---
That said, here some food for thought.  I am neither for nor against....but I do think people should be informed...and not just repeat what others have done.
Story:  One day a little girl watching her mom prepare ham for easter...and the mom take the egg shaped ham out and cut the small end off before putting it in the pan bake.  She ask her mom, ""why did you cut the end off?""  Her mom say, ""because that is what my mom always did.""  So the little girl go out and ask her grandmother, ""why did you cut the end off the ham?""  The grandmother replied, :because that is what my mom always did.""  So she turn her great-grandmother and ask, ""why did you cut the small end of the ham off?"" She reply, ""Oh hunny, I only did that when we had that one small house, the stove was so small it did not fit, so I had cut the end off...but as soon as we got the bigger house, we never did that anymore."" 
People in earlier stages, 1-5+, will KNOW, more often than not, that you lying (many parents will often not let you know they know, and instead become inwardly depressed), but we KNOW....so, when considering whether lie you loved one....also consider ALL the repercussions that come from the loss of trust (you hear just as many stories here of CGs who do no have the trust their loved ones....and they go through all kinds of hell....you have consider, if that what you want sign up for).  Another way look at it...is what if you had something wrong you...would YOU want know...or....would you like us lie you about it???  How would our lying you about it cause you feel???  <--- in earlier stages, THAT what we doing people with dementia. 
IF you use your own self as a gauge...you will more often than not...discern what going sit right in your heart.
Do we be ""brutally honest"" in order be mean assholes???  No, we don't do that either.  Sometimes I feel I am the only voice on here for ""Gentle Honesty"" and ""White Lies""....you know, the middle path.   
Also....SOME of us can handle the truth, and are even comforted by it.  For example, I am aware that I am struggling tasks...and that trips my hard wired alarm alerting me that there a problem....the ONLY thing that shuts off that alarm inside us, is knowing WHY.  Think of it, if you suddenly could no see out of one eye - you might be VERY alarmed...should I lie you say I will give you pie??   BUT, if I tell you WHY you can no see out your eye, oh that because you have a patch on it, you can settle again.  I certainly would not be ""brutally honest"" (which I read as ""abusively honest"", and say, what are you an idiot, do you not remember that yesterday they put a fucking patch on your eye.
SOME people on here, objectify us...dehumanize us....then it become easy treat us in weird ways that you wouldn't normally treat someone you love.  But we still human and we still in here, and are far more aware than we can communicate.  As well, (for those who religious) G-d always watching and sees EVERYTHING.  People often think because we can no readily answer their interrogation us that we unaware...this would be a mistake.
I can ALSO see and accept that lies CAN work in short term.  It will help you achieve an end.  For example, if we lie our kids and tell them as soon as they get on the school bus they will get ice cream (or they each getting their own pony at school this day)....chances are, they will race through their morning routine...and, it would work.  Which is the argument that they give you.  But, there also a very good reason we do NOT lie our kids like that....despite the fact that it works....and that is because it ONLY works short term AND it will ultimately cost you your relationship them.  And, in the long-run it makes matters worse. 
And caring our kids also a hard and thankless job.  It also caring for a human life when they are not verbal yet....so there are many comparables. 
You also have realize that lying, as a method, accomplish a means end....count on us forgetting it our short term memory....which we may.  But you also forget that we still have long term memory that will remember how you treated us (even if we forgot the lie).  And, you have a great many (more than should be) stories on here of loved ones reacting the bad treatment and the change in relationship.  I can see cause effect and put two two gether and I can see that those short term gains do in fact sign one up long term issues and ultimately make their job harder them. 
Lastly, if you are not a person who lie normally, consider the changes that have take place within you in order lie, much less lie someone you love (I often ask myself the question, ""for what would I give up heaven for?""...for example, would I give up my seat in heaven in order get in the car quicker?).  SOME people do that much easier than others.   But IT changes you.  And, it FOREVER, changes your relationship your mom. In order lie someone and feel good about it, you have see that person as less than you....as less worthy than you....as no deserving gentle honesty.  And people with dementia report this change in the way our loved ones see us, as the WORST part the disease, far worse than what the disease itself do us. 
All that said...I DO very much see some good example stories on here where I would likely lie my person, if it were me.  But I assume umpteen people will post why lie us....so I thought my time effort better spent post all the reasons why not, since that the less heard from side this issue.  Again, I am neither for nor against....I am all for being proud you self and being able look you self in the mirror. 
Best of luck navigating this very challenging issue.

2264.5,"You have excellent responses above from very experienced people, so I'm not going to repeat.
I started elder care during my baby years.  Find a facility that has Memory Care for your Mom.  Her care needs are already at, if not beyond, what is easily provided at home by yourself and Dad.  Unless you have the finances and plan to have a live in caregiver 24/7 with them.
Mom goes to MC; Dad lives in IL or AL ). A CCRC that has good care is a nice answer when different parents have different care needs.  Dad can visit Mom in MC without doing hands on care himself.
Ditto for you.   Having them within walking or scooter distance is not going to help a whole lot in terms of things.  The 100% burden of care falls 100% on you - plus there is no walking away when you need to, cause you are the caregiver.
I was still plenty stressed with all the oversight with my LO in a care facility, but his basic needs and safety were met.
So, my recommendation is to loose the idea of having them in IL 'down the block"" and go the full 9 yards with research for a CCRC.
Otherwise, your family will still be profoundly impacted on a daily basis.  You cannot parent well if all your energy is hands on caregiving for your parents.
Also, don't beat yourself up if something terrible has to happen in order for them to move - very typical.  But protect yourself by researching and knowing how to get them into what facility - having a first, second and third choice of a nursing home near you is helpful for hospital discharge planning and increases your chance of a good outcome.  Know what the policies are for conversion to a LTC bed in case they do not rebound from an illness.",1,1
25323.5,"chprobst,
     Delusions and hallucinations are not unusual in Alzheimer's disease. How they are handled, depends on whether or not they disturb the person with dementia. If the person accepts them and is not frightened, upset or agitated in any way, there is no reason to treat them and they will pass. If they frighten or upset the person, a psychiatrist should prescribe a medication to help relieve the hallucination or delusions.
     You can also cut down on them a bit by modifying the environment. Covering mirrors will keep a person with dementia from mistaking the image for another person.
Improved lighting to reduce shadows in rooms can also help and reminding the person who you are when you give care is also helpful.
     The important thing to watch for is catastrophic or violent episodes. If these occur, the person needs help immediately and should be taken to a psych unit for evaluation. Usually the police are the ones to do this.
Hope this information helps

40842.189,"Good morning,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY Lorita!!!! It is also my grandson's birthday, he will be 22. I had a really busy and eventful day yesterday,. Began with the wheel line picking up the electric fence wire. I always just lay that down on the ground when I irrigate and have always had the wheels just run over it. I do watch, but the hay is so tall I can barely see the top of the wheels. When I got it moved and went to hook it up, the wire was wrapped around it like a spool. I just left it, because I was in a hurry, figuring I would unwrap it in the evening. Began moving the second wheel line, and it ran out of gas. So I had to come up to the big tank and get a 2 gallon can of gas. Because I was hurrying, I ended up covered with gas. Finally got everything moved and hooked up. Tried to restart the pump and No go. It had been working great when I turned it off. I called the pump guy and he is so busy, I didn't figure he would get there until later in the week. By that time it was 9:30, I was supposed to meet Mel and Ramona a 10. Jumped in the shower and through myself together and was only 15 minutes late.
We went to the rodeo, and it was fun. Everyone has to be over 45. Most were over 60. Lots of roping and steer wrestling and barrel racing. But a few of the younger ones got on saddle broncs and 3 rode bulls (well fell off bulls). I went more for the visiting and there weren't a crowd of people, so it was easy to move around and visit with old friends.
I got home at 6 and had just finished chores when the pump guy came. He fiddled with it for a while and it started up. Said it just must have had a little rock or hunk of something in the valve the kept it from keeping a prime long enough to pick up. He is a very nice man, from New Zealand originally, and he visited for a while. He lives just about 10 miles west of me and said he was watering his hay too. Everybody is ready to cut about next week.
The sprinklers worked good all night, and I shut them off a few minutes ago. I missed one set because of yesterday, but I'm not worried about it. Will go out sometime later and unwind the electric wire and move the wheel lines back over against the fence.
Lorita, I am so glad Stormy is so much better. Bet you are relieved. He may have decided he is a house dog. Soon, he will be as big as a house.
It is good that your sister signed so you can find out how things are going. I'm with Jfkoc, why didn't they sneak those pills in somewhere? Probably last time she was in the hospital they immediately started her on medication.
So, now you are a gambler! Don's grandpa really did lose there ranch in a poker game. Ended up living in a little shack in the mountains making moonshine. His wife and 6 kids only had what they could carry out in an old truck and a couple of wagons. She stuck with him to the end.
After she died, he traveled around following the horse races.

     Your sisters diagnosis of cognitive impairment is not a diagnosis. It's a description of a symptom of something. I'll bet the physician she saw was not a geriatric psychologist or neurologist. This is what is needed. The reason is that there is at least one dementia that seems to bring on more problems with drinking.
She could have frontotemporal dementia or Alzheimer's disease, or even vascular dementia. It might even be a treatable condition and the drinking might not be related. Or, it could be.  Until she has an appropriate workup, the exact treatment would be hard to determine.
       Your sister should not be driving. She is a danger not only to herself, but others as well. Please let the police and her doctor know what is going on. Someone may need to disable her car.
       Also, a family member should obtain either guardianship or power of attorney to handle her affairs. An elder law attorney would be able to help you with this.

Since experienced Doctors including a psychiatrist are well aware of the Asperger's and my caregiving skills, thens it's an insult for low-life social workers from aps to question my services when im being overseen by experienced physicians, not people with a pitiful msw degree.  My degree is in a competitive male dominated field, not a pink collar field like social work. And although I've said we need 60 hours per week of subsidized home health care, none of the people who've raved about all the wonderful services out there have told me how to get in home care other than self pay.  Yes, the va will provide a measly 6 hours per week of home care, but what good is that when we need 60 hours when I'm working full time?  Since I'm paying in the five figures in taxes I think we deserve more assistance than we're getting.",1,1

We hit the one year Dx Anniversary in February. It seems so long ago and just yesterday, all at the same time. I can picture the scene in my mind. We were looking at the results of the PET scan and the neurologist explained ""this is what causes me to conclude probable Alzheimers"". 
Generally, a statement with the word probable would spark the question, what else could it be or are you sure? But we had been narrowing the field as we navigated the frustrating, long and painful (failed lumbar puncture) road to Dx. The labs and the neuro pysch tests and the interviews and observations were performed to eliminate other possibilities, like Korsakoff Syndrome, NPH, depression. We eliminated the others and the best the neurologist could give us was ""probable"". I understand why. Its just another example of the multiplicity of let downs this disease delivers.

I am still waiting for a post with the headline: ""Help. My LO has to wait 18 months to get into NH because of Medicaid look-back."".  Surely this would be a crisis if your LO could suddenly no longer live under their current circumstances and you had no place or person to care for them.  ",0,1
17791.9,"I agree with much that's already been said about siblings who are generally not as strong and who say ""X has this all taken care of"" and use that as an excuse to do nothing. 

In my own case, I'm the baby of 5 (the MUCH younger ""menopause baby""). My oldest brother who is slightly developmentally disabled and I were closest to my parents, while the 3 middle kids were always sort of absent. They loved Mom and Dad, but didn't seem to really feel a responsibility toward them. Some of that I think stems from the amount of attention my parents (especially Mom) gave my oldest brother due to his disability (autism). He was also a big bully and my mom would always scold the middle kids when they got in fights with him because ""they should know better."" I think some of those hurt feelings still linger today. 

And that hurts me, because I know my mom and dad did the best they could for all of us. Made some mistakes, sure, but nothing purposely hurtful. My brother was born at a time when kids who were slightly ""off"" were simply pushed through the public school system. No one knew what autism was. I know Mom somehow blamed herself for my brother's oddness and lack of social skills/poor school performance. She babied him as a result. 

Anyway, sorry to get so far off the subject. Just to get to my point, I think there are always dynamics at work that aren't always so apparent at the surface. I used to be so angry at my middle siblings for not stepping up, but over the years, I've tried to understand them better. They are all ""go along to get along"" people. They hate making decisions. They've all sought out spouses who are controlling and run the show (which is another reason they weren't around much as my parents got older). 

And, I think some of us just have personalities that are more ""take charge."" I couldn't sleep at night if I didn't know my mom was being taken care of. The only thing that made that better was to do the hard things that needed to be done. And I'm proud of myself for being that person.",0,1

 I have the Medical Guardian and am very satisfied with it.  It has the capacity to detect a fall -   I slid down in the mud last winter and they answered immediately.

It does give you a feeling of security.  I'm by myself and out around the cattle a lot.  If you get knocked down or fall it detects the fall.   I wear it around my neck, inside my clothing and except for the flashing light every 30-60 seconds no one knows I have it on.  No one has ever mentioned the light but I'm aware of it.

15281.2,"Hello and welcome to the forum
The symptoms and stages of dementia are not the same in everyone who suffers from it. A person's personality, life experiences, education, health status and many other factors all play into how a person progresses through the stages of dementia. So the answer to when does a person accept help can vary from right away, to never.
However, caregivers can do a lot to affect the way a person with dementia reacts to the problems associated with cognitive loss. The answer to your question about stress affecting her is yes, definitely. That is why it is important for caregivers to understand what a person with dementia is experiencing, and to learn communication skills to use when working with them. This helps to avoid or reduce the stress and upsets that can cause negative behaviors.
There are two good articles that can help you a lot right now. Once is called ""Understanding the Dementia Experience"" and the other is an article on communication skills. They can be found at: www.alzconnected.org/discussion.aspx?g =posts&t=2147512516

29225.2,"Guardianship (of the person) and conservatorship (of the property/finances) are governed by state law, which varies from state to state, but certain principles apply no matter what state you are in. When a petitioner applies for guardianship of a person, if all interested parties agree, it's likely that an order of incompetency and an order appointing a guardian will be entered more rapidly.  
  However, even if all interested parties consent, if the person cannot or will not consent, then in most cases a court will still require a professional determination of incompetency before removing the person's rights.  A psychiatrist, psychologist or other qualified evaluator will be appointed to do an evaluation. 
  Your father may want representation in the proceeding, too, because the guardianship could impact him if he loses control of his wife or of the martial assets, which gets pulled into the guardianship.

Nice sunny day here in north central Ohio.  What kind of soup are you hungry for Lorita?  I fix soup in the winter but don't care for it in the summer.  I have not picked many blackberries but have picked lots of black raspberries.  I always loved picking them especially because dad and I did it alone sometimes.

Yesterday was his birthday he would have been 85.  The berries smelled so good as they accumulated in the bucket.  I never worried about snakes but as I got older and often went by myself I started ending up with poison ivy.

It is easy for children, even grown children, to get emotional and concerned when they are face to face with their parent. Especially if they are reminiscing about the good 'ole days.

We're tucked in for the night, but my son has a bowling banquet tomorrow that I hope we get to.  It's only a mile from here, so I figured I'd eat there then get home, and back for my son.  We'll see what the roads are like.
My 4 1/2 year old grand daughter came for the day.  I adore her, and today she told me I was her best friend.  That made me cry.  She and I put up the tree.  I didn't put on lights, just ornaments, and strands of colored beads.  We set up the nativity scene on the dining room table -  probably best spot for when the baby is here.  I just finished his Christmas stocking.  I've made cross stitch stockings for the whole family over the years.

Margie - I hope you're feeling better.  When I was sick last month, it was so hard to keep up with it all.  I also got very crabby because I could see how bad this would be if I really got laid up with something.

Lorita - I think it's going to be the best possible thing for you to get the new dog.  You won't be getting Prince back, but you will be getting another dog, wonderful in its own way, to love.  About this time last year, one of our best friends lost his sister to cancer.  Two weeks later his dog died.  He was inconsolable about both.  His son got him a new puppy (they'd always had older rescue dogs) which was a new experience for him.  It made a huge difference.  I think he grieved both losses better with the new dog there to take care of and train.

Jim continues to be so confused by late afternoon every day.  He doesn't know where his bedroom is, where the bathrooms are, whether he's eaten - I'm going to get more time for in-home respite for him.  We may not be too far from hospice.

If I feel angry, that once again, it is Saturday night and my husband leaves Monday for two weeks on business but here we sit, watching tv and fixing dinner for mom instead of doing donethjng with my husband.....I am guilty for feeling that way. I read some posts on here from people who say this is precious time with their LO and how sweet they are but that isn't what's happening for me, I love my mom with all my heart and I used to pray every day to find a way to figure out what I am supposed to do. That didn't work and I realized it's probably because I am doing what I am supposed to do. My life is supposed to be like this and I better buck up. The trade off is, if I am going to have to live this way then I have to find a way to not feel guilty about everything I do or don't do. I have not mastered that yet. I don't think very many have mastered but feeling guilty to some degree. I don't want any of the negative feelings I have right now.

Just woke to dry heaves across the room and felt the need, as always, to look here for some guidance.   I feel so terrible for you.  The nastiness for me is what breaks the camels back and a few weeks ago turned my feelings very sour.  My energy to keep the act up was zapped to the point of having little to no patience.  For some odd reason he is being rather calm, nice and sweet this past week.  I'm thinking it's because he may realize that something is really wrong with him or that by some new firing going on in his brain, his anosognosia is not ruling his understanding of how on the verge he is.


But for you, my bridge and tunnel e-pal,  I wish I had an answer.  I think you are being very strong by asking for earlier respite and bombarding the docs with information.  I'm wondering if in this dire moment of need whether the VA is/has to be the only option.  If you brought Rich to a local hospital for geri psych eval, would your insurance cover it?  I mean you are dealing with an emergency situation and driving an hour to Philly does not seem to be the way for a person to respond to an emergency unless he is being transported by ambulance.   Could you broach this with his VA doc?  


Stupid question but is he acting out at medical day care?  Probably not if he is like all our LOs.  May be you could make a surprise visit at the medical day care and see if he reacts to you like he does at home.  Perhaps the medical day care folks who observe the behavior can initiate the VA response that is needed.  I mean what are they supposed to do if a patient needs medical care beyond their scope during the day?  Do they just send them home or arrange for something else?

Even though we intellectually know it's the friggin disease, there are some situations where those words just don't cut it or inspire whatever it's called for us to replenish the fortitude to carry on.


Keep us posted even if it just a four letter one word...

Her medications would be given consistently instead of the haphazard fashion that seems to happen with your father. Sedating residents the point of being zombies, as you describe with your uncle, is not the norm. You can certainly make sure that medication changes do not take place without consultation with the family. You mention that no one visited your uncle; you could visit your mother as often as you wanted; there is no need for her to languish alone. It is quite possible that your uncle would have had progression of dementia and death the same way whether or not he were in a facility. This disease can progress quickly.

  After a sleepless night with her I tried to doze off on the couch and she kept waking me up every 5 min as if she was just being mean and purposely didn't want me to be able to rest.  I have to admit I get pretty cranky without my sleep.  Then she asked me for a drink but wanted it in the can so she knew there was nothing else in it...as if i would try to poison her or something!  I lost my temper and threw the glass as hard as I could in the sink...it was plastic but I still managed to break it.  Later I found out she had a UTI and how that makes her paranoid.

  I noticed no one had responded to your post yet...i hope others will because we've all been there.  I did ask my doctor for something to help with anxiety and anger but oddly enough i haven't really needed it since then.  I'm lucky though because mom is more of a happy crazy unless she has a UTI.

Start by calmly removing yourself from the firing line as much as possible.  Reward her good behavior and do not let her ""practice"" her meanness on you.

6803.8,"BT413,  I was in a situation that was was very close to yours.  The only difference was, my dad was in his home.  He still had control of his checkbook, and I knew he couldn't be alone.  And of course, NO he didn't need any help, and he certainly wouldn't have been ok with paying anyone.  As Iris has explained, anosognosia is a standard part of this illness.   But I was still working full time, so it really wasn't a choice if my dad was going to remain in his home.  
The best way to get someone in the door, is to introduce them as your friend, with the (as you said) guise of housekeeping and meals.  If it were me, I'd do some hours before you return to work outside your home, so Mom gets used to the person being around. Let her see your friendship with this person, and how you enjoy her help and company.  And also use this time to establish a relationship between her and your mom.  Get some type of ""project"" they can work on together, which should also give you some uninterrupted work time! (My guess is, your mom is taking a lot of time out of your day)  
There are many people who go through an agency for help.  But what I did was reach out to anyone and everyone I knew to network and find help.  My goal was always to provide people that I knew my dad would like. So I was very picky with who I selected.   I wanted this to be about friendship, not his failing health and need for assistance.  My first one was easy.  She had been a companion care aid for one of my clients.  She was late 40s, cute, peppy, loved to joke and have fun.  My Dad couldn't remember her name, so he always called her ""Trouble"" (For him, that was a complimentary term!)  And it grew from there.  By the time I was done, there were a total of 6 of us who cared for Dad. (remember, he was in his own home, not living with me, so I had tons of hours to cover)  I named our group  ""Duane's Entertainment Committee""  and we all had fun with that. So it became his revolving door of friends who came by to hang out with him. (that's how he saw it)  The caregiving was our behind the scenes secret.  And it worked like a charm.  I never felt that a medical background was important, all I wanted was good people, who had common sense, and a willingness to pull together and be a part of our group.  We all learned together what worked and what didn't.  And since there is really nothing that can be done to cure this illness, I always said I wasn't treating a disease process, instead, I was supporting a man.  
The next part is tricky, and it may not work with your finances.  But what I did was pay the caregiver out of my own pocket to start things off. (save every receipt)  I knew there was money to eventually pay myself back for this expense.  But Dad would have refused any help, if he knew that it was costing him money.  So I just covered the cost until he finally gave up the pretense of being able to handle his own money.  It didn't take long, about 6 months.  Then when I took over his checkbook, I repaid myself for the out of pocket expense.   As  I said, don't know that financially that would work for you, but it worked like a charm in my situation.  Dad was never aware that I was paying someone.  But I got him established with the help and the money wasn't an issue.  If this would be a struggle for you financially, could you possibly ask your Mom for a loan?  That way you'd have funds on hand to pay the caregiver, yet your mom would be unaware and think she was helping you out.  Just a thought.  
As far as the the testing, I'd try again, using the excuse that she's coming with you for your doctors appointment.  Tell her you need her support and don't want to go alone.  If you can, make it a day of shopping, lunch out, and oh ya, we have an appointment on our way home.   My dad also refused to go for the testing, until I told him I'd take him and be there every minute.  Inform the doctors office in advance, they will have to play along and deal with a person who will not be terribly cooperative.  Or use the ""NEW RULES"" for medicare as the reason she must do this appointment.  Anything she'll believe, yet not feel like she's being forced into the appointment.  But the information gained will be helpful moving forward.  
Hope this helps in some way.  Keep coming back with questions.  Most of us have dealt with this before.

 Wrapping your gifts Christmas Eve by candlelight sounds really lovely and it is the artful side of you . . . . I can just see you in my mind's eye.  I have a haircut appointment on the 22nd.  I tried to get one earlier but it was their only opening.  If I do not get a trim every four weeks, I look like an explosion in a hair factory as my hair grows fast.  I think you are right, it will be easier on you to find a shop closer to where you live.   Some of the hairdressers here will actually go to the house and do hair; not many of them, but some.

It is a once a year splurge and of course while it tastes good, it feels weird in one's tummy afterward.  Part of the season.  We never did this when the kids were home, but we do it now when we are alone for that day.

It is such a great Christmas movie and a very good treat. Great script, great casting, great filming and great story with terrific subplots.   We cannot find our copy so we will have to find it on Amazon or Netflix.   Can't have Christmas without that film.  If you have not seen it, it is very worthwhile.

     Before you ask the physician about medications to help her, try to find out if there is something triggering her delusions. Are there unusual noises at night, do you live in an area where she might hear people outside? You might also ask her what the people are talking about or what the mean woman said to her. Obviously I do not know what your living situation is, but she may well be hearing something and mis-interpreting it.
     Please let us know how it goes.

I""m having huge issues re my mom driving. She is 87 and lives alone. She seems to be on the cusp re needing home health. We met with a provider this week. I fear for her driving ability and had her doctor require her to go for a driving evaluation. She passed but by a thread. They recommended against the in car assessment but said they would send her if she wanted to go. At present, her eye doctor, again, at my request, told her she cannot drive until her next appointment next week. I have spent 5+ hours looking for affordable transportation. She is furious with me, and today told me that if her doctors say it is ok, she will be going for the in car test. I am going to call both PCP and eye doctor Monday and hope that when they receive a copy of the eval, they will tell her she cannot drive.
It just amazed me that when she said she would go for the testing, I said i was going to ask her a tough question. I said that it was hard for me to understand why she would still want to drive when so many people said she was unsafe to drive. She told me she feels safe. Is this denial, or just part of the disease.
I live part time in Ohio where she lives and was supposed to leave for Florida next week. I am delaying my trip until i can find suitable transportation for her.

My mother was the same way... ""I'm perfectly fine to drive, I feel confident behind the wheel."" It may be fear, it may be denial, it may be the disease, it may be all three."" It's a pity that she passed. I think if your mom shouldn't be driving and she passes, you should take matters into your own hands- take the keys, disable the car etc. I took my mom's keys (though the DMV took her license before that) and she too was furious. They DO get over it. If you take the car (and in the winter, with snow sounds like you should), set up alternate driving; it's cruel to leave your LO stranded. 
Or take your mom with you and get in home help? Take care of yourself too, get help in her house and get it fast, and then get your butt back to FL. You can't do anything constructive for her if your injured- it's a less ALL CG need to learn, it's hard, but think about it...

  GREAT POST,   I can relate for sure.  My grandchildren were here this weekend for an overnight.   Both the girls drink a lot of water,  and always have a cup to go.  We were getting in the car and the little one forgot her cup on the kitchen table.  I asked my husband to JUST GO IN and get the pink cup off the table.  He goes in and does not come back out for 10min.   I finally approach the door to see what happened.   He came out with the cup, but the ice water with ice cubes was gone,  he emptied the cup and filled it with warm tap water.  WhAT!!!!
That story was just to show you all that everything we do for our loved one takes twice the time.   So I'm at the stage ""start of stage six"" where everything must be done by me, unless I have one of my Sons here.   
I started going to acupuncture to see if it will help me relax.  I go every two weeks.  Once a month I go and have my feet manicured.   I take a 20 min walk with my dogs each day,  and every six months I might get an overnight at one of my sister houses,  if the stars are alien.   I want to start a ""thi Chi"" class.  That helps you meditate,  and helps with balance.  It is a slow movement,  but helps with blood pressure.    I take blood pressure medicine,  but I noticed I forget to take my own medicine,  due to always checking on him.   SELFISH!   I think NOT!   I will get the book,  thanks to who mentioned it.

  You will find your equilibrium as that is your nature, but there are times that grief and wavering hope visit us and take their due; such happenings appear to be part of this unwanted journey and perhaps this is one of those times.   There is naught to be done but to experience it and then to put one foot in front of the other and it will be worked through.
  I would love it if you could gain some bit of respite, but considering Ray and the four footed friends, this looks a bit difficult.  Lorita; if something happened and you absolutely could not attend to Ray, the animals and farm for a week or so, what arrangements could you safely make?
  If you have a ""Plan B"" for anything such as that, is there any way you could get a bit of that backup soon and try to get a bit of respite for yourself?  Well; I am willing to bet not so easily done and you may well worry yourself to a frazzle if you took some ""personal"" time, but - just asking.
  I so wish there were something I could concretely do to be of help.  You know, I am mostly concerned with you but I hope it is okay  to address the physical part of what is presently occurring with Ray.
  First, have you read much on Intermittent Claudication?  This is what Ray has in his lower extremities.  With an abrupt change in his condition, I do wonder if he needs to be seen sooner rather than later.  Abrupt changes are a concern and often are harbingers that something is needing to be addressed by a physician.
  I agree that a five hour drive to the VA is not acceptable at this point for either of you, but there are hospitals with emergency rooms that may be much closer where he could be seen.  Does he have Medicare as well as a supplemental insurance?  This would cover the ER and any workup.
  My concern would be that he may have a worsening of the lower extremity issue; perhaps vasospasms, or of great concern - a clot in his leg.  Does the affected extremity side feel cold and pale or bluish or does it seem overly warm to hot and reddish?  If so, he needs to be seen asap at the closest ER rather than that lengthy drive. 
  Also, absolutely any infection in the body, whether it is involves his leg, or if he has a UTI will indeed cause the changes in his cognition and usual function.  This should be checked out also.  Despite all the other issues, the question of the possibility of a small stroke is raised.
  Of course, there are the other concerns, electrolyte disturbance or other condition causing his symptoms which bloodwork screening could determine.   
  As for treatment for his vascular problem, there are more or less minor measures like insertion of stents or using a catheter and widening the blocked areas.  If he is beyond that point of help, then the other option would be a surgery and grafting of vessels - the grafting would be a major undertaking for the condition he is now in and may well not be medically appropriate for him, but his doctor will be the one to let you know how things stand so a decision can be reached.
  In any case, is there a nearby ER you could bring him to so he could be screened by an MD?  If so and especially if he has insurance to cover it, this may well be your better option.
  Well dear one, it is 10:30 pm here and it is time for me to tuck it in.  You are in my thoughts and in my prayers and I am holding only warmest wishes for you.

I think Sun is making the point that achetylcholinesterase inhibitors (like Aricept) do nothing to prevent the progression of the pathological changes that are the hallmark of Alzheimer's.  Even with Aricept, those beta-amyloid plaques and tangles will continue to build up and more and more neurons will die and the brain tissue will atrophy.  It is my understanding that Aricept will not stop that from happening.
I think Mimi is making the point that drugs like Aricept DO significantly prevent the progression of the MANIFESTATION of Alzheimer's (the effects of the underlying pathology are not seen as soon as they would be if the individual was not taking Aricept).  Thus, drugs like Aricept are said to preserve functional abilities and cognitive capacities and thus extend the quality of life of the individual living with Alzheimer's.
Yes, there is a difference.  Sun, I understand your point.  However, I would argue, that someone without a background in pharmacology or without the ability to understand scientific jargon or without time to wade through scientific literature might take your comment and run with it in a direction perhaps you did not intend.

When he went to bed I was checking his BS and he had another white one on his stepstool by his bed, all wadded up.

26024.4,"This is very true. I often feel like I'm in a vicious cycle. If I spend more time meeting Mom's needs, I take care of myself less and as a result I'm grumpy & tired, which affects her. If I neglect Mom's needs to take care of my own, she feels it and she's more irritable. Finding a balance is difficult at times but is very important. Right now I am working on finding a new balance. Mom's needs have increased--she does not need help showering or dressing, but her dementia has progressed in a different manner. Her behaviors and memory are declining, and she is losing more of her judgment skills.  I am having to change and improve my approach to caregiving.
   I got up at 6:30 and did laundry, cleaned the bathroom, did some other housework, showered, and read my Bible. I have allowed myself the luxury of spending time here on these boards but will need to leave in a few minutes to go attend to some of her needs before going to work. Little time is left for myself, but I'm working on it. Mostly that is accomplished in small ways, with brief interludes outside the world of caregiving. Tomorrow night I will be attending my work's Christmas party, which is always fun. My daughter is excited about the opening of The Hobbit and is making plans for us to attend together. Those are ""big"" things in my world. Little things are those that most of do without thinking about, but I find to be small windows of happiness that I no longer take for granted.  Those times, for me, are a stop at Dutch Bros or Starbucks for a holiday drink for which I will pay way too money, or just opening a Christmas card from a friend. 
  My newest gift to myself: the newest edition of The 36 Hour Day. I had an older edition, but found it to be slightly dated so I purchased the newest edition. Last night I sat down and read through the ""Behaviors"" section and felt better after having done so. If anyone doesn't have that book, I highly recommend it. I bought the hard copy, but many of my caregiving media are downloaded to my kindle so I can read on the go, as my husband is doing the driving.

At the counter I placed my order: dipped vanilla cones for the caregiver and me, a root beer freeze in a cup for Lance, and a small cone for Henry, our one-year-old Jack Russell terrier. I was pretty optimistic about handling all this, but we had time, and it was very warm out, so ice cream seemed right. Lance can’t feed himself, so the caregiver and I were taking turns sitting in the driver’s seat while he was in the front passenger seat. The drink wasn’t as thick as I’d imagined, so spooning it into his mouth proved more difficult than I’d pictured. Then I tried holding it up to his mouth, but I obviously was not succeeding at this attempt, and before I saw it coming, he took the cup, and threw it across the front of the car leaving a stream of root beer freeze across the dashboard, the inside windshield, and yes, all into the air conditioner vents. Dismayed is a soft word for my reaction but woo-hoo, I calmly wiped up as much as I could, drove home with the air conditioner blowing full blast to hopefully keep the sweet drink from falling down the abyss behind the vents until I got home and used Q-tips to squeeze in, and try to sop as much up as possible, as if one can sop up anything with a Q-tip.

But just because she had the gene doesn't mean her children necessarily have it. As an example, her two sisters show no signs of dementia, and her oldest sister is 71.
As another example, when my wife was pregnant with my son, we opted for a gene study to understand the probability of his blood type. Reason being my wife was O- (both dominant and recessive genes) but her daughter was 0+ and the blood contamination from the C-section caused her body to create antibodies against the O+ blood. While pregnant with my son there were some troubling signs of fetal rejection. I was O+ (dominant) and O- (recessive). And a PUBS (Percutaneous Umbilical Blood Sampling) test (done in-utero) proved my son was O- and the problems we saw was a false alarm so monitoring were minimized for the term of her pregnancy.
So even though I carried the O+ dominant gene, my son is a double O-. Bottom line; unless your children are willing to perform their own testing there is no certainty weather they are at risk or not.",0,1

This disease, for me, has been eye opening about how things really are between family; mother-daughter, father-son, etc.  It is shocking to see that not all of our parents cared for us as we would have liked, but in spite of it, we provide loving care to them during this terrible time. It takes a lot of courage to do it, when it brings up the hurt, still inside, from our youth. To put those feelings to the side and be present each and every day, shows what a true caring person you are. Not enough time on this message board is devoted to pointing that out, but I feel I must.

When I told her I had seen it in the laundry room, she said, ""That's not mine, one of you girls (me and my 2 sisters) must have taken it! You just think you can take whatever you want from around here!""
  Of course, at the time, I didn't really know anything about dementia, and I started getting mad at her, which then caused her to hang up. Later, she started accusing my sister of stealing money, and on and on.
  It's really difficult to be accused of stealing by someone for whom you're making A LOT of sacrifices. It's hard not to get upset, believe me, I know!
  I do think that some medication may help immensely and is worth looking into. Once we got my mom on an anti-depressant, her negativity decreased significantly. I also agree with the others' suggestions about distracting her, although I know that sometimes it's difficult when the person is stuck on a topic and getting increasingly upset about it.

All of a sudden all of these people I knew had someone close to them with the same disease.  And I realized I was not the only with having to deal with this disease.  
My husband has moved faster into the disease then I thought he would so soon.  He is 65 now.  Most likely he had had this for longer then I knew.
We still have good times and he is a lot like he was before.  He forgets a lot of things-me and the kids included.  But he is now nicer then he was in the last 25 years of our marriage. I know there are bad things to come but maybe not.

She hasn't been able to walk at all for the past three or four days, due to not only balance issues, but general weakness.

We get so wrapped up in the day to day care issues it's hard to do this even for ourselves. Imagine what it is like to have dementia.......Try putting aside a half hour in the morning and another half hour in the afternoon just for things that make you and your LO laugh. For instance, I used to use a tape called ""baby faces"" which was lots of fun to look at. It was simply half an hour of tapes of the cutest babies making the weirdest, and funniest faces. My residents loved it.
You might also try a popcorn popper. People with dementia love watching the popcorn explode and having a little ""party"" with juice when it's done.
With summer coming, put a kiddie pool outside and put some bubble bath in the water. Pull up some chairs and you and your LO can kick up some bubbles. You can add some bubble blowers or squirt guns as well. (We also kept box turtles on our patio so the residents could see them lumbering by every now and then...instant smiles)
The whole idea is to get silly and laugh for a bit several times a day. It does wonders for lifting spirits and laughter is a great exercise.

41492.2,"Sometimes asking those quesions gets some interesting answers. One question I have found myself asking if something doesn't seem to pass a ""smell"" test, is whether the provider has an ownership or business interest in a service. One specialist seemed awfully slap-happy with MRI orders, so I asked. Turned out he was one of the owners of an outpatient radiology clinic that provided CT and MRI scanners. As long as the condition ""warranted"" it, it was kosher for third parties, but a bit too over the top for my comfort.
I have also found that some doctors develop a comfort zone with a provider such as Home Health or Hospice and know the staff well; and at times, I have found that the MD was actually one of the Hospice doctors on a part-time basis outside his practice, (no financial incentive), so that was his comfort level.
Lots of bits and pieces go into making decisions. Also, sometimes if the MD feels the caregiver is having difficulty in one way or another, they will order the Home Health or Hospice piece earlier than they would ordinarily have done.
I have been awfully grateful they were there; what would we do without them?
I'm recalling a few Members we have had in the past who moved to poorer foreign countries as cost of living was so much less and it was easy to hire housekeepers, cooks and ""aides"" to care for an elder for a pittance. Then the rubber hits the road and things get really, really difficult as the disease and often negative behaviors progress. No Home Health, no Hospice, doctors many difficult miles away, nil access to specialists and proper hospitals and no NHs, no trained/educated aides with oversight, and it all comes down in a heap.

The damage to his brain is likely causing the problem. He may not stop it no matter what you do or say. The disease can cause all sorts of bazaar behavior and it's important to remember that our LOs had these things going on well before diagnosis. 
I was very frustrated by things my husband had been saying and doing before diagnosis. Then the diagnosis helped it all make more sense.  
As long as your husband continues to try to keep up with the stresses of a job, he will likely have more struggles of this sort. Stress makes their memory worse and probably the behaviors as well.  He may or may not realize he's doing it at the time, but it sounds like he doesn't remember it after the fact. 
Im not sure if what he's doing is outright lying, or confabulation, but it is likely caused by the damaged brain. Some parts of the brain if damaged cause very poor judgment and/or adverse behaviors like stealing things. 
You won't likely change his behavior, so look for ways to relax and let it go, knowing it's the disease.

Then went to the shops to do a few errands.

Took back the food dehydrator that I got the SIL for Christmas that is not working...the shop has closed down!

Took Rons razor in to get new blades....they have discontinued that model. And he wanted a new electric one!

Went to the GP then to have him look at Rons knee.....he's been having trouble with it lately, it's the one he has had two replacements in. He has to have a bone scan, then see an orthopaedic specialist.

Also mentioned my ""sciatica"". Don't diagnose yourselves!!!!........seems that's not what I have...it's probably bursitis and sacroiliac inflammation. So I have to have X-rays and ultrasounds. And probably at least one cortisone injection, maybe two.

And the mower isn't starting so had to take it to the shop for service.

But on the bright side, the days are beautiful, not too cold, and things are generally OK.

We've had a busy few days. Thursday we went to see Rons sister..took another sister and SIL...she's an hour away, and can only drive 10k from her home, so we have to go there every time.

Friday went to our daughters for dinner.

Sat we went into Sydney (1 hr in the train) to see Ballet Revolution. Ballet, but not as you know it. A Cuban group with all the dancing to modern music. Very loud, colourful and full of movement. Ron seemed to enjoy it, so that was good. We then went straight to the nieces 50th birthday party. Unfortunately her husband thinks he is the only one who can cook and plan, so we left at 8 o'clock having had only a cup of soup...talk about disorganised! When we got there at 6.15 he'd only just put the chickens on, and hadn't even put the mushrooms or vegetables in the soups! I think everyone else ate about 9.30.

""House"" for instance, is feminine: ""la casa.""
""Pencil,"" however, is masculine: ""el lapiz.""
A student asked, ""What gender is 'computer'?""
Instead of giving the answer, the teacher split the class into two groups, male and female, and asked them to decide for themselves whether ""computer"" should be a masculine or a feminine noun.
Each group was asked to give four reasons for its recommendation.
The men's group decided that ""computer"" should definitely be of the feminine gender (""la computadora"") because:
1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.
2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.
3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for possible later retrieval; and
4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.

The women's group, however, concluded that computers should be masculine (""el computador"") because:
1. In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on.
2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves.
3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time, they ARE the problem; and
4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little longer, you could have gotten a better model.
The women won.

42514.2,"Storycrafter, we all need to vent.  Outstanding job with your post.  Empathy?  What empathy?  My parents haven't shown any in over 8 years!  What I've found is my folks are more immersed in their day to day mode; trying to make sense in their senseless 'mind' world.  Their anxieties are more pronounced, everything they do or say is much more exacerbated, combative and disconnected.
  How heartbreaking for them to not make sense of their world anymore.  I trudge threw the deep end of the pool and try to eliminate their sense of worthlessness.
  Mostly my folks feel the magnitude of what they don't remember or understand.  When their feelings are soooo close to the surface, have learned to redirect; and I hear mostly 'leave me alone', 'you don't understand', 'why are you telling me what to do'.  CONTROL ISSUES here.
  Folks are unDX'd.  Made an appt last Thursday as Mom had positive UTI tests from AZO strips, meds received, which she won't take.  Now I'm addressed as Dr. Dana because the real doctor didn't give any guidance for the treatment of her UTI.
  I am being challenged by Mom's sister for 'making too much' of the issues.  Aunt isn't here, only knows what Ma says while expounding confabulations.
  Didn't mean to turn your vent into mine.  Just had to reach out & tell you I feel your pain and discontent.  Welcome to the deep end of the pool, there are lots of us in the leaky boat treading water & bailing!
  Happy New Normal Year,

25752.3,"I am so sorry to hear about your grandmom.  I can tell you my story.  My mom lived alone in a senior citizens co-op apartment until last year.   She is 88 and last July she had a stroke.  It wasn't major, but enough to affect her speech and swallowing. Before the stroke she was having memory problems and was on medication - Namenda and Aricept for a few years.  She was in the hospital for about a week and then went to rehab and because of her dementia which did get worse after the stroke, she did not do well with rehab and it was clear that she would not be able to return to her apartment and would need 24 hour care.  I work full time and could not take care of her although I wanted to.  I knew she needed more care than I could give.  I have 4 brothers but due to each of our circumstances it didn't work out for any of us to care for her in our homes.  After a family meeting with the doctors, we decided a skilled nursing home would be best.  The first few months were very hard.  Not only for her, but I had a huge adjustment too.  I was her primary caregiver and was at her house every day prior to the stroke. But I now know it was best as she is safe and well cared for.  I still visit almost every day, but now my visits are focused on her, not taking care of her apartment.  She has adjusted and has made new friends and gets more stimilation than when she lived alone.
  I agree with Tomc5592, you should talk to a social worker and discuss all options with your family.  It is a very hard road you are on, but once the decision is made and your grandmom is getting the care she needs it will get better. 
  Luckily, years before this happened, I was able to get all the paperwork together for durable power of attorney, will and advanced directive.  So it made it a lot easier to get things done. 
  Please let us know how you are doing and sending well wishes your way.

  Our loved ones can be confused, they can suffer from apathy or lack of initiative, or simply not know what they should be doing when. 
  It sounds to me like bed is a safe haven for her ... but she likes doing things, as long as you point her in the right direction.  If she can still make her own breakfast, I don't think she's far enough along to need that much sleep.
  I agree with nessa ... set up a routine that gets her moving, and helps keep her from getting bored.  Boredom can end up causing behavioral problems.  And, as long as she's happy ""helping"" you ... the more she does, the more she can do and the longer she can continue to do it.",1,1
34166.4,"Thanks for sharing your experience, I completely understand your dilemma. I was fortunate enough to experience this behavioral problem only on rare occasions, and I was usually able to negate the behavior with a little redirection. My Anne was taking a very small evening dose of a pharmaceutical that kept her relaxed and helped her sleep at night. During the day she was usually calm and even tempered.
Anne enjoyed music which was always relaxing for her. Maybe that was because she was in the band in high school and continued to play trumpet, guitar, piano, and bells (in church) as an adult. So, I almost always had music playing during the day. SirusXM has different channels for different genres and periods of music; 50's on channel 5, 60's on channel 6, and so on. Her favorite was the 60s. With that period of music being what she responded to the most, I'm guessing her perceived age would have been between 12-18 years of age.
From what Anne shared about her childhood, her mother was somewhat abusive toward her. But she was always very close to her father. I believe that as memories regressed she didn't see me as her husband, but as her father. Although forgetting who I was and how much I loved her as a husband, I understood how much her father loved her and that she was his favorite child. That transference was somewhat comforting for me to know that she felt loved and protected by me just as her father did.",1,1

9618.13,"I understand this is a pretty common challenge, in elderly in general as well as specifically in dementia patients. There is a long term correlation between poor sleep quality and risk of AD. It is plausible that the amyloid cascade is connected with something that is supposed to happen during sleep stages, something subtle or even invisible day by day, but something that builds up over decades.
In terms of long-term risk vs reward, both ambien and seroquel are really scary to think about. Maybe in a short term emergency, but even then, there are better options if you talk to a doc who knows/cares. A lot of researchers have pretty harsh things to say about primary care docs who regularly prescribe atypicals like seroquel.
For example, is it possible your LO is sleepwalking because of the ambien?
Also be careful about anything with benadryl in it, like tylenol pm. Benadryl makes most of us FEEL sleepy, but also disrupts sleep quality in the process A lot of seniors get hooked on it, not knowing better and not sharing with their doc because its OTC. 
I havent heard of anyone particularly worried about melatonin or trazadone. Some people give too much melatonin, you are looking for a trigger not a sedative. 
You might also think about light therapy, annoying to practice but no side effects (good luck on cooperation though.)
One 'trick' my sister figured out, was that mirrors are VERY disorienting to dementia patients. Even regular window glass can be reflective at night. If you have a big mirror you dont want to take down, my sister found some stick-on film at home depot for $15 that makes a mirror look like stained glass.  Left an eight inch square uncovered in the center for hair brushing.
Meds appear to offer a quick fix, but remember that brains are really skilled at reprogramming themselves - they will often become tolerant of a medication's initial effect, which then leads patients or docs to increase dosage, which amplifies risks and side-effects only to soon be re-tolerated. Which then leads to poly-pharmacy. Etc, etc.
One last suggestion, I wonder if YOUR quality of sleep might be just as important to family functioning as your LO's? Do you have the option of turning off the nanny cam, securing the room, and getting your rest knowing everyone is safe for the night?
I'm not saying sleep regulation isnt important, because it is. But think about how much gas you have left in your tank, and the best way to make the most well-being for everyone in your house.

Hopefully the doctor can help her. Sometimes just changing your look-like removing a beard, or dyeing your hair can make a difference in their perception of a person.

11569.14,"To DavidTX, 3 Stooges Fans, et al:
As a fellow historian who has pored over many historic census, tax, and estate documents, the early terms for mental impairment were often assessed by untrained data recorders, some of whom could barely spell. Mad (madness) was a very early term; lunatic and insane followed. 
By second half of the 17th century, a crude system of assessing extent of impairment used ""idiot"" as the most severe category. An idiot was considered to be uneducable, unemployable, and barely in possession of self preservation skills (note: a Mongolian idiot had what we now call Down Syndrome). 
The next rung up the ladder were imbeciles (divided into low, mid, and high grade). A moron (aka ""feeble minded"") represented, relatively speaking, the highest functioning of mental impaired individuals. These categories were loosely assigned by approximating mental age equivalence until the 1911 introduction of the modern IQ test. Thereafter, 0-25 =idiot, 25-50 = imbecile, 50-70 = moron (anyone scoring below 50 was generally considered uneducable). These rankings were primarily of interest to potential employers. An imbecile could perform menial chores, but only a high grade imbecile could be entrusted with "" complex"" menial work (I.e. factory assembly line). A moron could perform basic work that required some degree of reasoning and judgement.

may I share my thoughts with you..my husbands mom when she became anxious with her surroundings would ask me something and then leave the room and come back and ask me the same questions again..she would do this during times she was uncomfortable..uneasy..and I would do my best to stay relaxed and reach out to her and touch her hands and this seemed to help her relax in her environment..I gave Margie a B complex vitamin and a vitamin E every day also..and I found them to really help her stay relaxed..by trial and error we learn what works for our loved one and what does not..some days the questions over and over was how Margie communicated with me some days..she needed to feel she was in control and trying to find her way..in her journey in this thing called Life..not always fair as Margie was such a good mom and special human being everyone respected and loved.
Margie needed me for stability and I had to stay calm and not show that I was nervous or upset  no matter how stressed she seemed ..as this she needed from me as her rock sort of speak..when .Margie could  no longer remember my name.. she  would call me honey most of the time and I had such love for this old woman my husband calls mom before alzheimers and when her memories were taken from her..we were the keepers of her memories and her dignity..this we could give.

At the time he was a skilled, highly educated nurse anesthetist and worried about the effects of briefly not having oxygen to the brain. Now, I doubt that he ever thinks of that long-ago concern. (He was pretty much fine afterwards, but there are so many possible contributing factors now to his cognitive decline that who knows where or when it may have started.)
I don't know if we're still in an early stage or not. All I know is that some days he seems like the husband I've long known and some days he is confused, very forgetful, doesn't know the day or month, and most days he doesn't remember a conversation from the day before. Some days he is an adult and many days he is a child. Recently, he was diagnosed with yet another serious disease, melanoma, and I'm going to have to insist on going inside the exam room with him from now on because he doesn't have any curiosity about the stage, treatment, etc.

I've written about my DH's battle with DH's baths before and how I won him over with warm bathroom, shower visor, etc.  Prior to winning him over, I bribed and pleaded with him to take a shower/bath, neither of which worked.

I sat down in front of the door and out waited him to take off his clothes.

There was no way he was getting out of the bathroom with what he had all over him....I was ready to sit there all day, if needed.

5311.5,"First, I would most certainly see (or be referred to by your doctor if necessary) a geriatric psychiatrist and communicate exactly what is going on. He or she can tinker with doses of medications to help with this kind of behavior. Sometimes it takes some time to get right but stick with it.  In the meantime I would remove or lock up anything that can be used as a weapon, such as knives, golf clubs and certainly fire arms. You don't want to find out if her dementia will progress and she will become more aggressive with this behavior. 
Second, everyone who is around her needs to be educated on Alzheimers.  No fighting with her, correcting her. Ask them to read a book on it and the Alzheimers Assoc website. They need to understand that she is not in control of this behavior. There is no deciding not to tolerate it, no setting boundaries. It simply won't work. Your mom can't control her impulses or decipher and express her emotions appropriately. Her brain is impaired and the disease is causing this. Asking her to stop or issuing ultimatums will be banging your head on a wall. Sure, it may be embarrassing to take her out of the house or it may hurt your feelings when she swears at you. You all must have thick skin. Try to validate her feelings and redirect her but never argue. 
If any of you feel you are in danger, call 911. Explain that she has Alzheimers and needs to taken to the hospital for psych evaluation. This is more common than you may think. From the ER they will transfer her to a geriatric psych unit and keep her until meds are sufficiently controlling her outbursts. There are other threads here on that topic if you want to read more. 
You could also call the Alzheimers Association Hotline at 1-800-272-3900 and ask to speak to a care consultant. They are social workers who specialize in dementia care and family dynamics. They could help you with getting your family on the same page and direct you to resources in your area.

I hear the cry of my soul whispering in my brain.
  My immortal beloved was a wanderer. He had lost all sense of time and place. He could hardly speak. He was with symptoms of dementia/AD stage 6. He died 10 months ago. On the day of the fateful early morning of his death, when he woke up, he was looking at me not knowing for the very first time who I was, where he was, who he was. He felt totally, completely lost. Abandoned by the world...
    Dark clouds seemed to be circling his total being. He was in a panic. Almost without breath. Full of stress. He was so upset! He looked as if his brain was completely disappearing from him. He wanted to run out of the house fast. He wanted to escape from the prison of his mind. Right now!... He was going 'mad' looking for me. Looking for the front door. I had never seen him like that.  All he could say was, ""There. There. Over there.""
    It was January. The temperature was -30C, not counting the wind chill factor. A few feet of snow on the ground. We were in pajamas. I said, ""We have to get dress to go out"" He went to the locked door. He was able to unlock the door. I ran and I stood like a warden in front of the door and I said forcefully, ""NO!"" He had the strangest look in his eyes. For the first time in his life, he pushed me aside. We struggled in front of the door. I stopped him. I prevented him from running away, barefoot, with no coat, with no mitts, with no hat. I prevented him from being frozen to death....
    Half an hour later, he had a heart attack. I was on the phone with 911. He died. He died in my arms. I was loving him. He was loving me. I began to scream to the gods. I felt I had killed him. I felt I had 'abused' him.
  Of course, the Coroner said that living with the stress of symptoms of dementia/AD for over 10 years + a family history of heart attack were the cause of his death... The Coroner said to me, ""Madame, there was no way of preventing his heart attack.""...
    My 'reasoner' knows and understands what the Coroner said, but in my heart my guilt still consumes me daily.
    I am healing... slowly... somehow. I am struggling with the existential question of ""guilt""... with a zillion should have, could have, would have.

One day the store decided to install a machine for squeezing fresh orange juice.

Jim was fascinated by this new machine, and he asked if he could be allowed to work the machine.

The manager refused, and Jim asked why he wasn't allowed to run the new orange squeezer.

5351.8,"Hi - we recently had to move my mom to a new MC facility a month ago as the old one closed. This is her 3rd change in a year - 1) 24x7 home caregiver; 2) small private MC facility. 3) new more professional MC facility.  During all three changes she has had major anger spells where she kicks and hits. Usually it’s attributed to an UTI but not this time. I personally feel it’s from all the changes but the current facility is very concerned if they can manage her.  She’s very tiny but gets aggressive. One of the things I’d like input on is whether others have gone through this and if constant communication and visits by family help or hurt. Part of me feels that the constant interaction with us may be attributing to her frustration because she can’t decelop a routine and has constant reminders of the life she used to live. I equate it to when i my children first started daycare and the staff where they had to get us to it without my involvement.    I spoke with the nurse and she thought the interaction could be a concern at first but my brother has heard differently.  
Has anyone experienced the same and have thoughts on the best approach?

15943.2,"I'm so sorry about your mom. I lost my 74 year old mom to the effects of vascular dementia about 2 years ago. My mom also experienced huge issues with communication - just just couldn't seem to get the words out. It was frustrating for her, and she essentially gave up. She also suffered similar issues with incontinence and no recognition of needs for a bowel movement. She also complained of pain, sort of unspecific in the leg/hip area. Boy she saw so many doctors for that pain - but they could not find anything wrong anywhere. No amount of pain meds worked so the doctors think she was having phantom pain from brain damage. She also had the same shuffling issues and became unable to walk the last year of her life.

One thing you probably know is that vascular dementia seems to progress in a stair step fashion - stable for awhile, then a steep drop. It is shocking. My mom seemed very stable and I left on vacation for 3 weeks (my sister was with her). Suddenly one morning my mom could no longer bend at the waist or move her limbs. She went off to the hospital and died within a day or so.

14635.1,"Since this is a fairly new onset of worsening ability, her dementia specialist may have some insight into this for you.
It may possibly be that she has a neurological effect of decline causing gait apraxia. This is not unusual. This can occur as the dementia advances and it is a degenerative process that affects the neurons. This often occurs in the bilateral frontal areas of the brain.
One can go to www.rxlist.com to look up each med and read the extended list of each medication's side effects if one wishes to rule out medication causation. Look for the terms ""gait"" or ""apraxia,"" or ""extrapyramidal symptoms.""
At this point in time, using a walker does not sound safe. It is not about not knowing how to use a walker as much as it seems to be a neurological effect which may preclude even trying to use a walking aid. If she has spinal stenosis or any sort of back problem, be very cautious about using a gait belt. The doctor can advise you about this.
Neurologists often do assess gait capability and gait abnormalities; it can tell them a lot about what is happening within the brain.
I am very sorry this is happening; it is truly sad to see further decline and losses as the condition progresses. Of course, safety is the most important priority, and if this is indeed part of further damage to the brain and not a medication effect, it will progress; you may want to think about that ""Plan B"" you already have in mind should she become unable to ambulate whatsoever.

11982.38,"After my mom died of pneumonia complicated by sepsis due to having had vascular dementia, my dad wanted to stay in their home, but it was clear to me he could not cope there alone and the cost of caregivers was over $6,000 per month plus we had to pay for housekeepers, pool service (for a pool which he did not use), lawn service for a lawn he did not use and then there were the frequent calls for help with plumbing problems and the TV not working and the garage door opener not working and any myriad of problems that dad could no longer figure out how to solve and me having to make multiple 140 mile emergency and non-emergency round trip drives per week including trips to the ER in the middle of the night, do all the grocery shopping and slap another bandaid on dad's leaking ship.  I kept bringing up to dad that since had has no relatives in their city and most of their friends were deceased or in nursing homes - usually having moved nearer to their adult children in other cities, he ought to come live near me.  He ignored me and refused to consider moving. In the meantime he started having problems with incontinence due to prostate surgery.  He was literally wrecking his house peeing all over it and he only used his bedroom and bathroom, the tv room and that was about it.  He also was struggling to pay his bills and many times phoned me to take him to pay a bill on that specific day as the service was about to be cut off.   I tried pleading with him that this situation was affecting my marriage, reasoning that I could visit him more if he lived near me, begging and even crying.  He refused to move.  Yet he was lonely and spending all his time sitting in a dark room watching TV and not doing anything with his life. At Christmas, we put him up in the IL we wanted him to move to but he refused to commit.  Finally my husband had enough and went over and met with my father man to man and told him he would be moving near us end of discussion.  And we didn't back down.  I found a great senior moving company and we put dad in the independent living facility.  I got him the right doctors, got him into Depends, he has caregivers for only part of the day and is doing quite well in the new environment.  Eventually he'll have to go into Assisted living, but for now, he's OK in IL.  I cleaned up and renovated his home and sold it.
Looking back at the situation with my mother, I had wanted my parents to move closer to me when mom was diagnosed with dementia but my dad refused.  He blocked my efforts to get mom the care she really needed but did not have the wherewithal to be her caregiver.  I recall one weekend where the caregivers could not get to their house due to an ice storm that pretty much put their whole city on pause and dad let mom go out the front door and she fell on the ice.  Luckily she was only bruised, because if she had broken something it is unlikely the EMT's could have got to them and she probably would have died of injuries.  But dad didn't manage her at all.   In the end, I felt to some extent that I had had to sacrifice my mother in order to appease my father.  Might she have lived longer if she had been in a Memory Care facility?  Possibly.  But I'll never know.  Certainly mom wanted out of her house towards the end of her life and there was a great Memory Care Facility near me that would have been ideal for her, but dad wouldn't consider it.  So when things continued to go downhill after mom's death, my husband I decided we weren't going to put up with it anymore.  We had spent 3 years with our lives in constant turmoil due to my father's bad decisions in regards to my mother's care and his inability to manage his own household.   He was being unreasonable and paying way to much to stay in a home he wasn't really using and costing us a lot of money in gasoline and time driving back and forth constantly - the drive was a total of 3 hours, sometime 4+ in traffic alone much less whatever we needed to accomplish once we were over there.  When you are working, that's a big chunk of your day.  So it was all of these things that caused my husband to lay it on the line with him and force him to make the much needed move.",0,1

And NO patients are ever discharged from from MC at their own request. The reason has nothing to do with all of legalistic copy-paste from above. In reality, facilities can only discharge a patient into a safe environment. Since a MC patient is not safe on their own, the facility cannot discharge them on their own say-so. So don't worry about a MC patient revoking their POA and getting out of MC on their own. It doesn't happen in the real world.

This s strawman nonsense. Ask an administrator to sign a document that they have the LEGAL RIGHT to keep a patient against the patient's will

My mother's vascular dementia was very aggressive similar to what you are describing with your mother.  
For the duration, I put my feelings aside and just focused on doing whatever I could to help my parents.  That and some Xanax for when I would have a really intense anxiety attack got me through the ordeal.  My dad was no housekeeper or cook, so I had to hire help for my parents. They lived in another city an hour and a half away from me. They had not written POA's or setup a family trust, so we had to do all of that.  Then I realized that mom needed a caregiver.  The caregiver would do my parents laundry and look after mom who was manically checking the mailbox 20+ times per day.  Dad fought against that, so I told him the caregiver was a laundress.  It took dad about 2 weeks to figure out that the ""laundress"" was actually a caregiver.  In very little time - really about 6 months, I went from going to my parents town once a week to buy their groceries to my dad calling me for everything and me making emergency trips to their town at any hour of the day or night for emergency room visits or to fix some household problem such as plumbing, AC, Heating, electrical - you name it.  I suggested that my parents move near my husband and I so it would be easier for me to help them, but dad refused and no matter how much I reasoned with him and begged and pleaded, he would not do it.   Dad got colon cancer and we had to go through surgery (thank goodness he didn't need an ostomy) which was followed by him getting post anesthesia delirium and then he needed prostate surgery as the colon cancer surgery caused him to have to leave the hospital catheterized.  By the time all that was over, mom was late stage 6 and I had 24x7 caregivers in the house with my parents. I was spending about 50% of my time staying at a hotel in their city as there was no place for me to stay at their house - I'd had to move mom into the guest room because she was up all night with a caregiver sitting with her 24x7 and also they kept it about 80F in there all year around which is too hot for someone having hot flashes like me.  Mom died that spring and dad was insisting on staying in his house although, there was no family in his town and most of my parents friends were either dead or had moved away to live near their adult children. Dad was only using the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and TV room of his large house - he never used the pool or any of the other rooms and the house was getting really run down.  The driving back and forth continued until my husband finally got fed up and gave my father no choice and we moved him a year and a half ago near us.  You want to hear something crazy?  About a week after dad moved near us he said, ""Macy, you really hit it out of the ballpark with this place.  Your mom would have loved it here!""  OMG. I had only been begging him to move for 2 years and he could have saved me tens of thousands of dollars and thousands of miles on my vehicle not to mention some scary situations when I was driving in the wee hours of the morning and yes, I knew mom would have loved that place, but he refused to even consider it.
So, I guess the great lesson I have learned after all of this is that when your elderly parents need your help, move them near you if you don't have siblings living in their town who can take care of them.  The sooner the better and don't take ""no"" for an answer.  Otherwise, your life will become nothing but an endless cycle of travel for the duration.  Your husband can be your best advocate in making that happen.  Have him have a man to man conversation with your father and insist on the move.  And then just move them. 
As far as your mom's verbal abuse of your father and you and others, my mom did this.  The doctor put her on Risperdal which helped somewhat although she was still paranoid and suspicious and angry.  As you know it all has to do with what parts of the brain are damaged by the disease.  I learned to communicate with mom in such a way that I could calm her down.  Whenever she would start going on at me, I would face her and look her in the eye very intently and say ""OK.""  That's all I would say and I would continue to look at her intently and since there was nothing she could say to argue with ""OK."" usually mom would wander off and do something else.  This worked in all sorts of situations, like the time before I hired the caregiver who helped do all the laundry - I was doing load after load of their laundry and mom launched into a nasty diatribe  ""How would you like it if I came to your house and did all your laundry?""  and I would say things like ""That would be great!"" or  ""Definitely do that next time you visit me!""  and she would continue on being nasty to me and then I just did the ""OK"" thing and sure enough, she stopped and wandered off.    I tried to teach dad to do the same thing, but he never was able to break his lifelong pattern of explaining things to mom.  But that's not what she wanted.  Mom just wanted to feel like she won the argument.  That's why ""OK"" worked so well.
I found that mom responded to music and that was hard for her to get angry if she was singing and dancing, so I would start songs and she would sing with me.  Interestingly enough, sometimes she would start singing just behind my in time and we'd wind up singing a ""round"".  What she seemed to be doing was listening to the words I was singing and following me.  Whatever.  Lacking any way to have any form of meaningful conversation with her, I just chose to do what I could to make her happy and music made her happy.  
I know you are really mourning your lost relationship with your mom.  But please remember that you will always have that relationship in your memory.  For me, after mom died, I chose not to keep any photos of her when she had dementia.  I know mom would NOT want me to remember her like that. She died in 2014 and in the time since, I can almost pretend none of the dementia stuff ever happened and I can remember mom as she was before the disease.  Almost...  And I know that is what mom would want.
 I spent a lot of time thinking about why mom got this disease.  In the Bible it says that God knows every minute of our lives before we are even conceived and that God has a life plan for each of us.  It has occurred to me before that things happen to people as part of the fabric of the story of their lives and my mom was a nurse.  She saved a lot of people's lives.  She was also present at many patients deaths and knew what that was like intimately and dying was the one thing she feared the most, so much so, she would never talk about that.   So at the end of her life, she got dementia - most likely due to her having had Graves Disease years earlier.  The bad and very noticeable part of her disease only lasted about 2 years.  The doctor told me it was the most aggressive case of dementia he had ever seen.  And at the end, mom got pneumonia complicated by sepsis which shut down her kidneys and she passed on gently without fear or knowing what was happening to her.  And after it was all said and done,  I think that was a sign of God's grace in her life.  Perhaps this disease was God's final gift to someone who tried very hard during her life to help others so that she didn't have to face that which she feared most.  She didn't suffer and she passed rather quickly, surrounded by her family during a prayer.  It may be that as you think over your mom's life story, it is the same for her.   
My mom was a happy person and she hated funerals.  After she died, we had a brief family only internment ceremony and then a celebration of her life for all her friends at the country club where she used to play golf up to 5 times a week.  I ordered the food I knew mom would pick and we served mom's favorite Chardonnay wine and I hired a Frank Sinatra stylist to sing - he was her favorite singer of all time.  There was a display of some of mom's things and photos from her life, but I kept the event very positive and unsentimental, exactly the way  mom would have wanted it. Her friends all said it was exactly like my mom to take something sad and make it happy.  Some of them even thought mom had planned the event herself - there is no higher compliment as that is exactly the effect I wanted the event to have on her friends.
I'm really sorry you are having heart problems.  Do take good care of yourself.  This disease is rough on the entire family.   Your dad is going to need a lot of help to get through this situation, emotionally, physically and even mentally. For your own sake, it may be good for you to have a psychologist or minister or other counselor to talk with and vent to.  I had to find a strength inside myself that I didn't even know I had to get through this.  One of the things I chose not to do was burden my husband with everything that was going on.  He knew mom had dementia and knew when I was out of town but I handled most emergencies myself and only involved him in the emergencies in the last 9 weeks of mom's life because he works full time and needed to be able to focus on his work.  I got really good at hunting down the right companies to help with the various household emergencies and I found a Compounding Pharmacy that delivered to my parents house and could manage a great deal from my city, but there were still times when nothing less than my presence was required.   If you don't have siblings living near your folks, then definitely make them move near you.  Even if you do have siblings near your folks, you may have to move them near you in order to manage the situation and not drive yourself to exhaustion.  
After mom died, it became apparent dad was not functioning in his home and he wasn't doing anything with his life.  We moved him to a IL facility and now he has people to talk to and things to do.  He likes the music programs and he has a lady friend.  I have to say the last thing I ever thought I would be doing would be taking my 92 year old father and his 91 year old girlfriend on a double date with my husband and me!  But then dad always thought mom would outlive him.  Instead she died at age 87.  I had imagined a future where after dad died, I would take mom on cruises and to Disneyworld.  But it just was not meant to be.  Life is funny that way where it takes unexpected twists and turns.  It has become apparent that my father is losing his memory and also, I'm seeing symptoms that indicate he may have Parkinsons.  At least he is, so far, placid and sweet natured, except when he has a UTI.  So I'm in for round 2.  
Some other folks here were discussing which was harder: caring for a baby/child or eldercare and the consensus is that it is eldercare which is the more difficult, especially when dementia is involved.  I used to have a coffee mug with this quote:
""We the Unwilling
Led by the Unknowing 
Are doing the Impossible
For the Ungrateful""
That pretty much sums up eldercare for a person with dementia.  The rest of the quote is:
""We have done so Much
For so Long
With so Little
We are now qualified to do Anything with Nothing.""
How apt.

You and your husband should have been advised to wind down his business when the diagnosis was made and he was prescribed Aricept.  Many patients ask about work but they are already too compromised to work effectively.  Some patients are allowed by their employers to remain in a limited capacity until they qualify for disability or reach retirement age. 

There is much that can be done to make his life more functional but he will not be able to work.  Your husband may improve a bit once he no longer has the provocation of working.  We patients do better with a simplified, orderly life with less confusion.

26269.4,"You will find with this disease that you assess and reassess constantly - sometimes just weekly or daily, sometimes from one hour to another. Obsess and reassess seems to be my mantra some days; it must be how we handle the stress of this challenging disease.

We hear of people in stage 5 and good health who do pass away long before they even reach the last stage, and others in poor health in stage 7 who hang on forever. It is a crap shoot, I suppose, and while we all want to know, none of us gets an exact answer. Again, must be how we cope, by wondering and wondering.

Personally I believe you did the right thing by applying for SSDI and Medicare. You do not know how long this disease will give you and your wife.  I admire you for quitting your job before you could even get SS yourself; I hope you have a good tax accountant and elder law attorney who can help you protect whatever retirement and other savings you have for your own future needs. It must be rough!

We all ask ourselves all these questions and you are so normal it is scary - I actually appreciate when people put it in writing on these boards so I don't think I am the only one like this. See, you have helped me today! I needed that reminder.

Keep her at home as long as it works for both of you; take a good hard look at her needs and what you are able to handle. And be realistic - you may be able to handle anything that comes your way, but is it in your best interests? She would not want you to sacrifice your soul to care for her.

Make no promises to yourself or your wife, other than the promise that you will always give every decision your most careful thought.

We were told that the MCU would be better for my mom, but have found that's not the case.  We think that the staff slacks off because they know none of the residents is ""with it"".   The schedule shows 5 activities a day--only 2-3 actually take place.  They sit for hours in front of the TV, tuned to a channel the STAFF prefers. We regret moving my mother.  Another move is ALWAYS taumatic, we found out, even if to another frequently-walked wing on the same floor.
Right now I'm contemplating another move because I don't like seeing my mom living in filth.  Perhaps your A/L is much better than the one my mom is in.  Just be sure to spend at least 5 days walking to the MCU,  at various times, and observing what's actually happeing before moving your mom there.

7960.7,"Perhaps you can pitch it as a temporary stay until the doctor says that she can return home. Then, hopefully she will slowly settle and break ties with her previous home. I moved my mom from one state to another last year and she NEVER wanted to leave her house. But after a short nursing home stay and then returning to home, she realized it was too quiet there and she was scared. She wanted to move. So, I was finally able to move her and then she wanted to go back. I told her that she had to stay at least a month and see how it goes. If it didn't work, then we would go back. Then after about a month, I moved her to a different IL place because I didn't like the first one and she didn't put up much of a fight. Then I had to move her into AL after she fell. She still wants her life to return to normal, but she doesn't complain about it too much. I think she likes the activity around her and hopefully your mom will, too. But if you sell it as 'temporary at the request of the doctor' she might not say as much.

Do you know the cause of the PCA?  In most cases, it is generated by Alzheimer's Disease, but it can also be caused by Lewy Bodies Dementia or other more rare dementias.   Loss of vision is one of the cruelest aspects of PCA.
It would be good to ask this question re primary diagnosis as the symptoms you describe sound like some of the LBD dementia dynamics that can happen.
In LBD, medications can make a difference in behaviors and ramp them up to a significant degree.  It was quite stunning for me to realize that some antibiotics for some dementia patients can actually cause behavioral and other negative symptoms.
I learned this the hard way. My LO, (who did not have LBD), was prescribed a particular antibiotic and behaviors went over the moon.  Initially, the physician said the changes were secondary to dementia, but my gut feeling was that it was not; onset was too abrupt and behaviors were over the moon along with hallucinations that had not been experienced before.  The antibiotic was finished and the symptoms and behaviors returned to their usual baseline. I had NO clue about the antibiotic causation at that point.
Some months later, an antibiotic was required again; the same antibiotic was prescribed and once again behaviors became different and so much more florid along with hallucinations which had not been in evidence since the antibibiotic was given the first time.  I asked for the antibiotic to be changed; it was, and the hallucinations disappeared and behaviors did become less dramatic.
In our case, the antibiotic that was not tolerated was, Levoquan.  I had to have that put on my LOs allergy sheet.  Later, I found that this can happen even in persons who do not have dementia and has happened with Levoquan.  NOTE:  Not everyone will have such a reaction to this antibiotic which has been a good antibiotic. And, behavioral symptoms can be induced by different antibiotics for some people.  Most of us have no clue about this and it is difficult to diagnose.
I would have the meds reassessed including polydrug involvement where one med or more is interacting with other meds to induce such symptoms.  Klonipin can cause increased confusion and irritability, but that is not known if it is the causation or contributor in this situation; and it may not be.  It is something for the specialist to assess.
Any abrupt change needs to be addressed, so I would call the specialists office and pitch a  need for an asap appointment.  You may have to go beyond the front desk personnel and speak to the back office nurse; an RN if they have one and be a bit dramatic about the abrupt changes so as to be really ""heard.""  Considering the depth of the changes, this would not be hard. 
In appointment, I would also ask if the diagnosis can be confirmed for type of dementia and have an non-Parkinson's LBD ruled out so medications can always be more carefully prescribed.

We are at that point now.  DH is mid stage5 and declining fairly quick, diagnosed stage 3 two years ago. He lost a handful of jobs before diagnosis so we used up our savings to stay above water and not foreclose. I packed us up, sold the house, found a rental, got all lawyer work done, got the disability SSDI(there was no retirement package and no work disability) then purchased a small house with the back pay as down payment, all while working as he was declining. Then my mother In Florida passed from Alzheimer’s. I got us through it being frugal  ( downsizing in every way) and relying on my strong faith and good friends, a great sister and worlds best dad. I should probably throw in the dog as being the world’s best too! All this and trying to help my children deal with the trauma as well has been enough for a book! 
Don’t mean to rattle on, but our family has been hit hard beyond any of our expectations. The future looks bleak, as there is no chance of private pay. It would be straight to Medicaid land and hoping for the best. The best case scenario would be for him to pass quickly from another condition before reaching the final stages. Before Medicaid takes what little we have while medical science keeps him alive to the final stage.  
Yes more HONEST research is needed, especially lifestyle and environmental changes. AWARENESS is key in order for those in charge to step up to the plate. ",1,1

Your sister and niece sound awful, but even the most loving visitors can cause upset.   My mom used to have melt-downs for weeks after visiting with one of my sisters, in spite of the fact that my sister is 100% loving and honest.  I think her visits just wore my LO out, and also reminded Mom of how she wanted her life to be different. 
You are obviously preparing for the visit as best you can.  Good luck to you and your mom.

19573.19,"Hi dear Lisa:  Since your mother continues to be completely mobile and is still high functioning despite her changes and delusions; does she not have a dementia specialist?  If so, perhaps it is time for an appointment; if not, this may be the best time to make an appointment with a good Neurologist who routinely sees dementia patients as part of his/her practice.
  Our primary care MDs are wonderful at many things, but they are not on the cutting edge of dementia and neuro diagnostics and management, and this can often make complex matters even more complex and difficult.

196.6,"Just to shorthand for people who have not looked at the video, the perspective of the video is that there is therapeutic benefit to lying, that it is a compassionate act, that we should not view this through the lens of our morality regarding lying outside of the dementia context. 
I certainly now engage in compassionate deception when necessary to reduce my mother's anxieties.  My father, in her eyes, is increasingly alive (though he's been dead for over six years) and she will ask where he is.  He's at Home Depot, he's working on a project, etc.  After my mother moved into memory care, we falsely believed in her early weeks there that she would eventually understand/remember that her sister (who had been her companion and eventually caregiver for years) had broken her pelvis and moved out of state for rehabilitation/retirement.  I think that we did much more damage in thinking that she would eventually be able to ""understand"" or ""remember"" this.  Now, when my Mom asks about her, I say that she is ""out shopping"" or that we will see her later ""at home"" where my mother still thinks she lives.  Therapeutic lying is compassionate and necessary.  
P.S.  The video contains, in my estimation, a good warning for caregivers at the end about the importance of paying attention to their own physical/mental health and a succinct analysis of what needs to change in the U.S. healthcare system to address the realities of dementia. ",0,1

My Mom is nearing end stage dementia. She was also recently treated for a UTI. She lives in a care home, has only been there a little over a month. She is yelling and screaming and often talks gibberish. She keeps taking her dentures out, so at times, she is very hard to understand. I understand what you are saying about you can see on her face that she is trying to find the right words and can not. She gets very frustrated also. She is also very agitated, and just so unhappy. She was recently in the hospital for other health issues, heart problems, a blood clot in her leg, fluid in her lungs, and a skin infection on her foot. It's so very hard isn't it? My Mom's condition became worse in a short period of time. My father passed away in January and since then she has really gone downhill. I have found a support group where I live, and it has been a lifeline for me. It is so good to be in a room with people who really understand what you are going through and can give suggestions, support, and it's safe to cry. I also hope that I can help someone else with my story. I suggest you try to find that for yourself. It has been a difficult journey since January, legal things, trying to get veterans benefits in place, life insurance policies etc, and taking care of my Mom. Her GP didn't want to prescribe meds that would help her calm down because he wanted her to go to a psychiatrist. Well, this week I had my Mom start with a local hospice. Difficult decision. Hang in there! Just do the best you can and don't beat yourself up. Try to get some sleep, because you need to be rested to help your Mom. Good luck and blessings to you.

6.4,"Welcome to the boards. I know that is can be very frustrating to try to help and be there and someone not be able to accept it or work with you.  It's good you realize the issues and are reaching out to get help.  That's huge. 
For a while, I thought that my LO was being mean, rude and uncooperative with me and I had no idea why.  I tried to help her, doing what she asked, but, she was not grateful, only rude and accusatory.  Later, she was diagnosed with dementia and it all made sense.  I had to let go of my misgivings at that time. She was no longer able to think clearly.  My expectations of her had to be lowered, because, she was not able to work with me on it. So, I came to terms with it. I know that's hard. 
 Support sites are great, as is counseling.  It might also help to read about how people with dementia act, so you can better understand why things are the way they are with her now. She may forget many things that she said or have no reason for doing the things she does.  She may also have no empathy for others. It's tough to separate the person from the condition.  There may be good days, but, bad days too.  I try to focus on the good ones. ",1,1

Blood thinners help but no, they do not cure it. All they do is extend the time between events. With your dad, however, it's hard to say what his course of illness will be.

Perhaps the doctor could give you a better idea although I suspect he will tell you no one knows.
  Aricept has been shown to help some in vascular dementia so it's good that he takes it.
  The important thing is for him to be as comfortable as possible and any time you find something that brings him a little happiness, do a lot of it. It will be a pleasant surpise each time.

You've received excellent advice. I'll just add a couple more things to think about.
Whenever possible, try to anticipate needs and/or volunteer without waiting to be asked. I agree with the idea of having the main caregiver put together a list, but often this can feel like one more thing for me to manage and for long-distance siblings to pick and choose what they're willing to do vs what I might actually need them to do.
If you start a project, see it through. It's frustrating and inconsiderate to dump unfinished tasks onto primary caregivers who already have their hands full. Example: you shop for new clothes for Mom, take care of mailing everything to her, then walk away and expect the caregiver to hem up slacks, take care of returns or exchanges, etc.
No coaching from the bleachers. No second-guessing. Unless you have reason to believe your parent is unsafe or being harmed, keep your criticisms to yourself.
Finally, please do not use distance as an excuse to not be present. VISIT. As a working caregiver, I constantly use my paid vacation time to take Mom to doctor appointments, spend hours in the emergency room, deal with immediate needs, and on and on. At times I really resent it when my siblings don't want to sacrifice their own vacation time to come out and help take some of the load off my shoulders. Trust me when I say: even if no one openly confronts it, the double standard gets noticed.
I appreciate that you're asking caregivers for input. I wish you well on the journey ahead of you.",1,1

  We have sort of similar situations in that my mom was just put on an anti depressant and is also on an antipsychotic, but different than what your mom is on.
  I don't have experience with Lamictal, but my mother was just put on a low dose of Lexapro while she's been in the geri psych unit.  She came in because she was delusional, not eating, having visual and auditory hallucinations. A real mess..which  I frankly believe had to do with the Seroquel she was on. Either it was causing a lot of these issues or wasn't helping her.  She wasn't depressed before that psychotic episode started, so I was a little alarmed that  he put her on the Lexapro.( The not eating had seemed to me because she was paranoid and really out of it.) They told me after they started it on the weekend and I wasn't able to talk to someone till today...which irked me a bit, but the social worker was very reassuring and read me the doctor's notes, which helped. My mom's also  had issues with anxiety though so I'm sort of glad she's on it.
  She's also on Abilify now.  She was on Zyprexa for several years and a new doctor switched her to the infamous Seroquel.  We considered putting her back on Zyprexa again, but she had pulled out of a bad spot several months ago with Abilify so we decided to try that. I can't help wondering if starting that now has caused some of these depressive symptoms.

I'm sorry you are in pain.  That makes all things harder.  I understand wanting our LO to be happy. That makes us happy and helps us function better.  Maybe step back and see the big picture.

Hope for the best but prevent the worst.  Hoping to avoid the worst without ensuring her physical safety is not taking good care of her.  You are saying she is compliant with you at all times but not compliant without you? The hospital will not take care of her while you are sleeping.  Can she be trusted to stay in the room with you?  Walking out of the hospital while you sleep seems like a real possibility. I am not trying to be hard on you.  I see a trend where you post that things are hard, really hard, and people make suggestions that you reject. Maybe you are in that tough place between needing outside help and outside help being impossible.  One day you will cross over that ""needing help"" line, if you haven't already, and you need to see it when you cross it. I think most people here think you have crossed it.  Is it possible that the people in your life that don't help can't because you reject their suggestions or view of the situation?  I struggle with letting other family members help because they can't do it as well as I can. I have to let go of that or I will never get the help I need.

If there is not an issue with anxiety, high blood pressure or seizures, you might consider trying the inhalation of various essential oils (such as bay laurel, clove, holy basil, and rosemary) for a couple of seconds once or twice a day.  These oils contain the same compound as Aricept which binds to the peroxynitrites.  But they also contain phenols which convert peroxynitrites into a less dangerous form, inhibit the formation of peroxynitrites, and partially reverse the damage done by peroxynitrites.  In theory (and in my own experience), they are much more effective than the drugs currently prescribed for Alzheimer's disease.",0,1

8236.2,"With ALz and other types of dementia causing diseases, actual brain cells are being damaged. If the PWD is having cells compromised in the regions that control short term memories (the hippo campus) then they will have short term memories loss. With Alz, that is often the first place where cells begin to die. In time, other sections of the brain are affected by dying brain cells. In your mother's case, the cells that control her ability to reason and her emotions may be affected so she has no good control over her bouts of crying. There is a name for this when it becomes a problem. It is a condition called pseudobulbar affect (PBA).
 I am NOT saying your mother has this, but it is one thing you might want to check into.

Did you do it for real safety of just to make one feel better. It all sounds like to me that to stole her property by taking over her car to your name without knowing. If anyone should be calling the police we should as you clearly admitted here it was done in a sneaky way. I base all this because you tell us she is in early stages very well capable of making many decisions if the right person speaks to them. It very common for all Dr to tell them to sop driving. They told me 7 year ago and I am still out there driving well and my wife will tell you that. I am amazed how so many of you just are so in agreement with what I consider to be such injustice. Dot you believe the patient should count in all this. I also agree if she can no longer drive she should be removed but nothing in this gave that information for anyone to make the right call.

10993.2,"Hi Nattie. Welcome to the message boards.  I am sorry that your grandmother has dementia.  It is a sad and devastating disease, both for the PWD (person with dementia) and those around him or her.
Dementia can progress rapidly, but conversely, there are treatable conditions that can look like dementia or make dementia appear to progress.  A rapid behavioral change always raises suspicion for a urinary tract infection.  If this change is sudden, evaluating her for UTI, as well as getting a physical and possibly labs per her physician's recommendation is a good starting point.
People with dementia are not in denial.  People with dementia have anosognosia, the inability to recognize that something is wrong. A way to look at it is that her ""reasoner"" is broken.  Just as you would not expect a person with a broken leg to run a marathon, you cannot expect a person with a broken reasoner to independently engage in activities, make good decisions, or perform complex tasks. Also be aware that the hallmark of dementia is being unable to make new memories.
Socialization and engagement are key.  It is great that your grandmother has a household of family around.  To engage her in activities, you may need to change your approach.  Instead is saying 'Grandma, you need to do these crossword puzzles because you have dementia and it is good exercise for your brain' try 'Grandma, let's do this puzzle together.' Then work together to do it.
This site has many helpful resources.  Other good resources are books by Naomi Feil, a book called The 36 Hour Day, and Teepa Snow videos.  I am sure that others with far more experience will chime in here.
Good luck, and congratulations on your baby.  You are wonderful for taking care of your grandmother.",1,1

I'm not a religious fanatic.  Just a person who loves God.  Scares me to think where I'd be without Him actually.  My Mom was diagnosed with dementia in 2009.  She is not as far along as your mother so I can't begin to imagine what you're going through, and I'm not trying to.  My mother has used guilt my whole life.  Even now I think about how I'll manage to move her in with me, my husband and our 4 children one of these days.  I can easily see myself becoming like you.  I fully intend to try to take care of her and I hope I'll be objective enough if and when the time comes to put her in a good facility if necessary.
But as others have posted, if your mother were in her right mind, she would not want you to suffer.  She would be more concerned with YOUR health.  It's wonderful that you have taken care of her and admirable that you want to continue to do so.  But think about something:  If this were happening to a friend of yours and you were on the outside looking in, how would you advise her?
If you get sick (physically or mentally) what will you have accomplished?  I'm not fussing, or at least I don't mean to be.  This disease is not worth being a martyr.  You're right, it steals slowly and agonizingly.  It isn't fair.  It just plain sucks.  But it isn't worth losing yourself.  You have the rest of your life ahead of you.  You are a daughter, yes, but you're other things as well.  Remember that.

  ""She's gone just for a little while... You will get to see her soon... She is working on something really nice just for you...""
  I personally had the hardest time in my mother's middle stages, where she remembered some things but not others. Back then, she would ask things like, ""Is my brother still alive?"" Or, ""Do I have a husband?"" And she could comprehend the answers.
  As she moved into the final stages, at first I didn't realize that was happening. But once I understood that she didn't understand, I had to start talking ""as if"".
  ""Is my brother still alive?"" - Me: ""You mean your silly, wonderful brother who likes to _____? He always makes [makes, not made] me laugh when he _______.""
  A couple of weeks before she died, she started worrying that her MIL (who had always belittled her and tried to hurt her) was coming to see her. She asked, ""Is L. coming to visit? I thought I heard someone say she was coming to visit."" (My paternal grandmother L. died over 10 years ago.)
  Me: ""Oh goodness no! I told her to stay away. Hey, I am watching out for you!""
  It doesn't help to remind her that L. is dead, because in her mind, L. is not only alive, but a potential upsetting threat.

One night the furnace went out and she was insisting on calling Dad in the hospital so he could come and fix it or tell her what to do. Her next solution was to get out the phone book and start calling random places to see who could come fix it. What was a somewhat simple situation was completely overwhelming to her and she had no idea how to handle it. Had she been by herself I'm not sure what would have transpired. It was easy enough to look at the service sticker and call the company who had previously serviced it - but that was completely beyond her capabilities at that point.

    I have two bad knees from driving a School Bus for 25 years.   However the ortha pedic Doctor gave them a series of shots..  3 one each week..  I forgot the name.. i'm thinking 'haligen""..sp?   but it puts like a jelly in-between the joints.   It has been two years that they are better..  
Glad you liked the pic..     I hoped you like the pic of my Doxies..  one was of my hubby in uniform... holding Ella the Red Doxie.....

You have a great day too...

After years of reading the posts on these boards, I'm struck by how many people react to the confused behaviors of dementia in their LOs with hostility and antipathy.  They seem to think that the dementia patients are deliberately trying to make the family members' and friends' lives difficult.

They seem to view the dementia patient as a cantankerous, ill tempered old person, not as a sick, disabled person who needs understanding and assistance.

For all other diseases and ailments, family and friends gather around and support the patient.

More needs to be done to publicize that dementia is a disease, not a personality disorder.

That would be my number one concern, if I couldn't trust my LO with my grandchild ever for five minutes, due to distracions, anger, bad driving, I wouldn't wait the six months",0,1
