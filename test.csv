Hello Everyone,
  How to Use a Durable POA- A few key bits from the internet concerning how to sign on behalf of the Principle using ""Attorney-In-Fact"". 
  How should I sign when acting as an Attorney-in-Fact? 

  You always want it to be clear from your signature that you are not signing for yourself but are, instead, signing for the Principal. If you just sign your own name, you may be held personally accountable for anything you sign. As long as your signature clearly conveys that you are signing in a representative capacity and are not signing personally, you are okay. Though lengthy, it is therefore best to sign as follows: 

  Rachel Wilson, by Howard Carver as her Attorney-in-Fact 

  In this example, Howard Carver is the Attorney-in-Fact and Rachel Wilson is the Principal. 

  The exact wording is not important. Just make sure you indicate that you are signing for your Principal, not for yourself. 
  Excellent point!  We jut had a court case here in RI -- son was DPOA for mom who went in to a nursing home.  BUT he signed his name, none of the DPOA for . . . . Mom passed and court held SON is responsible for the nh fees because of the way he signed the forms.  OMGosh!!!  Do be sure to sign AS DPOA FOR . . . .

  I can relate to all of this.  I too am a grandmother.  Before we placed my mom, I was staying with her.  I finally told my siblings we needed to hire a part time aide which we did.  But all I did with that time was go to my home to pay bills, catch up on other stuff and connect with my daughter and grandson who live with me.
  Talk to your husband.....show him your post here if you think it would help....and calmly tell him you need a break and you will need a break on a regular basis.  Whether that means hiring another aide, your husband stepping up and taking care of his mother or another family member relieving you, it has to be done.  If it's not, it will only get worse for you.  Insist that you need this and it cannot wait.
  Your grandson is obviously impacted by this and your husband should understand this.    
  As others have posted, placement could be an option.  It can be expensive but it doesn't hurt to look at places.

  Zyprexa was the med that actually *worked* for my mother. But it is NOT (I repeat, NOT) a drug that should be given as a one-off shot. It requires steady and consistent dosage to be effective.
  It sounds to me like they know Zyprexa would work, but are not giving it to her regularly for some reason or another. Maybe ask why? [I am neither a doctor, nor an RN, nor an attorney. Just giving you my personal experience.]
  Do NOT romanticize the care you would be able to give your mother. Just because you can calm her down when you visit does not mean you would be able to do so long-term. I seriously doubt you would remain sane yourself if you were dealing with this at home.
  Finally, if you do not have a POLST (Physicians Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment) in place already, please get one as soon as possible. You are absolutely, 100%, positively correct: It makes no sense to keep LOs alive who have zero quality of life.

Explain the tone of the phone call from this HOA person to you.  How unprofessional it was.  Tell them how upsetting it was to receive such a harsh and rude call. Tell them that you have had a very recent and significant loss in your life and to receive such terrible treatment through an HOA who you pay your dues to is very unacceptable and unwarranted.  I would complain to the officers of the HOA and document this.

43585.12,"Excellent post....
 Where to begin? hmmm
  (1) "" how do you balance meeting your wife's need to be loved with your role as a caregiver?""  A super important question to think about: (1.1) the need to be loved  (we ALL need that!). There are many different ways to express love. Love never dies. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways... (1.2) the role as a caregiver/caretaker/carepartner . We all would like to give, as well as receive, responsible gentle loving care... Each of us has her/his own history, reality, personality. Different strokes for different folks! In the silence of the night we all ponder deeply about the LO's need to be loved, our own need to be loved,  and our caregiving duties and responsibilities. 
(2) ""My wife, with moderate dementia,..."" . Well... since a diagnosis has been given, and you have written the words moderate dementia, we all know what that means: her brain is 'broken' and her 'reasoner' is not functioning that well. A different modus operandi has to come into play as the symptoms manifest themselves. We are constantly adjusting, adapting, and, above all,  accepting (with agony in the heart) that dementia is what it is... Very, very difficult, but doable.
(3) ""my wife...is going to a social worker/therapist, its kind of an experiment"": Therapy is extremely valuable for some and not for others. It goes without saying that it has to be a good therapist with knowledge of and expertise in symptoms of dementia. I imagine the so called 'experiment' is something that you are doing under the advice of her doctor and/or your daughter. It could be of help to YOU definitely... and in the process of help to your wife... if you learn how to communicate (emotionally, verbally, and physically) with DW more effectively, she might behave differently with you. Maybe the therapist has to find out firstly, what is really, really emotionally bothering your  DW. The therapist is trying to help DW with her '. It is not marital counselling in the normal sense... it is a different kind of therapy... Sometimes this type of therapy is very effective for the caretaker in order to learn to be a more patient, understanding, loving, communicative, and better care partner and not to have to depend as much on prescription meds.  
I would love to go on and on, but I don't want to get stale... I better quit while I'm ahead.
 ... (Let us all try to rejuvenate the original feelings of falling in-love with the loved one)...
  And you, Jack... Keep on. Keep on going.

   Read 36 Hour Day and that one resource will advise you that the caregiver(usually oldest child) should act as demented parents' advocate and that decision may have to be made faster than you think.  However most of the time you should have seen the same symptoms in their parents or grandparents.  If you live nearby you may have observed their poor driving habits or the sheet metal damage on their vehicles.  You should have noted the same repetitive questions or inability to handle their finances.  There are 5.5 million persons diagnosed with Alzheimer's in this country alone.  There are legal methods to force parents who deny the disease and refuse to go the Doctor.  
   The longer you or they delay diagnosis and then treatment, the more danger they are to both themselves and other persons on the highways---if they continue to drive.

I had a hard time letting him go, I thought I could get him interested and participating.  He was just very tired and it was difficult for him.  He just wanted to be still.  He didn't feel well and he didn't want to do anything anymore.
I know human contact is always important, but that doesn't mean it has to be activities or talking.  I know what my dad liked in his life.  He liked to be in the sun, he liked to listen to music, I'd bring some of his favorite foods to enjoy.  So that's what we did.
With my mom, her journey with Alzheimer's was a quick decline, she was very confused.  My creative mom who had always loved to draw, loved to needlepoint, crocheted beautiful blankets for her grandchildren, couldn't do these things any longer, her decline was fast and hard.  My mom always took care of her appearance.  With Alzheimer's she couldn't do this, didn't have the ability.  She eventually lost her speech.  I thought of the things that were important to my mom before the disease.  I would wash and set her hair, put on her favorite perfume.  One day as I was drying her hair in the kitchen with the sun streaming in, we were listening to Bing Crosby tapes.  I put White Shoulders on her wrists and she smiled.  I knew I reached her and that moment made us both very happy.
It's hard for us because to try to think of things to make it better and sometimes all we can do is be near, hold their hand and be soothing, letting them know that we are nearby and there is someone who cares and loves them.  We have to be their light through the darkness of the disease.",0,1

The neuropsychologist is a special psychologist who tests brain function through detailed testing.  The testing takes five to six hours, sometimes spread over two days.  There is a preliminary interview period for the neuropsychologist to get an idea of what the symptoms and complaints are.  Patient and caregiver are asked to attend, although the testing itself is usually done solely with the patient. 

My neuropsychologist went over the test results with me and made recommentdations, and referred me back to the neurologist.

For my first neuropsych testing done in 2003 I had to pay cash (~$2,000).  In 2008 a different neuropsychologist accepted Medicare and insurance payments so my co-pay was ~$200.

Read the Diagnosis section at the main web page, www.alz.org. 

Laboratory tests for hormonal and nutritional disorders and other medical problems are done by the neurologist or PCP. 

When you get an opportunity, get a copy of The Alzheimer's Action Plan by Dr. Doraiswamy and Lisa Gwyther from Duke University.  It has good information on the diagnostic process.  It is available in libraries.

Make sure you get your husband to sign the HIPPA forms so you can discuss with the doctor.

  I think the best solution would be to have her for a ""visit"" and then go from there.  You will need to radically change your thinking. If she is as impaired as the doctors say, she is in no position to stay at home alone, and you cannot reason with her.  Her ""reasoning button"" is broken, and you will only stir up a hornet's nest by trying to convince her of her disability.
  So what does this mean for you?  You need to embrace ""loving lies"" and say whatever you must to get her to cooperate. 
  Your options? 
  1) She lives with you.  Tough tough tough thing to do.  Think very carefully before you take this on.
  2) Having her ""visit"" you, then place her in a facility.  A good NH or ALF will be able to handle the dementia.  You will need to do your research, but others here have done this.
  3)  Have her placed in a facility in FL.  This may be a temporary solution until you get the dementia sorted out.  She probably needs a meds adjustment.  There are meds that can help with the aggression and emotional uproar. 
  There are no easy options.  All will require lots of loving lies and effort on your part. I suggest you call the hotline from this site, and consult with the experts there.  Learn all you can about Alz, and prepare yourself to change the way you deal with your mom.  You can't reason with her or treat her the way you would someone whose cognition is intact.  You will need creativity and a new approach.

I can't help you much with this discussion on if this is normal, as I never used a memory care unit.   But I had to jump in here with a thought about your topic and post.  
When I looked at a memory care facility and a nursing home (just in case)  I often found their lists very odd.  I  couldn't help but be shocked at some of the things they mentioned.  i.e.  they charge more if your parent needs depends, or if your parent needs to be fed, or if your parent uses a walker.  It got to the point were I expected them to say they charged extra if your parent used water or breathed air.   WHAT THE HECK??????   This is a memory care unit.     And so too your question about being combative or out of control.    For HEAVENS SAKE.........you guys are a memory care unit!!!!!   Are you telling me your aren't trained to handle this?  That's someone else's job?  
It's as though they are saying, ""Yep, we're a memory care unit, just as long as your LO doesn't have any of the problems associated with mental decline.""   For heavens sake..........that's your job!   And at those prices, you should HANDLE EVERYTHING in house. 
But I'll even go so far as to call this care facility community a total farce and a racket, if I hear another care facility suggest that you should hire an outside aid to come and spend time with your parent.  (And people do this!  They pay outside people to come in a spend time with their LO.)   
So maybe the administrator of the facility needs to be asked exactly what services you are paying for.  Because apparently it doesn't include any items that take any time, any services that take person to person interaction, any services that include hands on care like changing or feeding, or even anything that involves physical impairment (like using a walker.)  Apparently, what we're asked to pay $5-7 grand a month for is a building, a bed, food, and a lock on the door so the person can't get out.  (And the best one in my community has a base price of $9,600 per month, but with all the additional charges, you're lucky if the monthly bill is right at $12,000)       
 Maybe what we should ask them, is what is their ""definition"" of person who need memory care?  Cause mine includes all of those things we've listed, i.e. incontinence, balance problems, poor fine motor coordination, catastrophic events, and then some.  If we were smart, we'd start our own care facilities and all be millionaires.      ",0,1

  Whatever pain she was on seemed to be controlled with tylenol suppositories.  But she appeared to be anxious so they started her on ativan transdermal gel.  They would rub it onto her chest or upper arm and it absorbs almost instantly.  But what we witnessed over the course of about 3 days was sort of scary.  Within a few minutes of the gel being applied, she would calm down and sometimes drift off to sleep for maybe 20-30 minutes.  Then she would wake up and stay awake, alert, and totally wired for HOURS.  I was thinking they needed to increase the dosage or the frequency of the ativan for anxiety.
  But the doctor asked me how she was reacting to it and when I explained the overall reaction through the hours after treatment, the doctor said that Mom was probably having what is known as a paradoxical reaction to it.  In other words, instead of calming her, it actually caused her more anxiety.  They stopped the ativan and she calmed down in about 12 hours.  They didn't use it again until just a few hours before she died.

That is a pretty profound statment to make. However, I agree with you. My St. Mother sucked the life out of me and replaced it with everything that is wicked and unhappy. There are those on earth who are takers rather than contributors....and so, we end up taking the trash out.
 
My father was not wicked or mean. He refused to comply to any doctors orders or recommendations. His way or the highway when it came to his health. His docs read him the riot act, fell on deaf ears.
  I told him point blank with his last bout of congestive heart failure, that I was done watching him committe suicide and expecting me to mop up after him.
  The last time he was in the hospital for a solid month of Oct.2010 for congestive heart failure and had a difibrulator installed. Two weeks later in Nov. he needed a retinal repair job. Three weeks after that he had a kidney stone problem. Two week later he was dead of a massive heart attack.
  The year before that he was in and out the hospital with congestive heart failure, 2 seperate kidney stone retreavals, open heart surgery, bronchitus, and a hernia repair. All that from end of May to end of Dec. 2009. His health problems were relentless.
  Why should I run around with docs and hospitals for him when he refused to cooperate or comply?!?!. I regret doing that. And I will make sure I never do that again for anyone. He took me for granted. God forbid he should take his BP meds and watch his salt intake. Nope, instead he did it his way, took one HBP pill every wednesday and ate Chinese food and losts of fast food and pizza constantly.
  He liked to check himself out of hospitals against doctors orders. He tried that at the cardiac rehab after the open heart surgery, because he didnt like the bland food and I refused to bring him McDonals fries and burgers. I told him...you check yourself out and  they will cancel your medical insurance and charge you $350K for the open heart surgery. That fib worked.
  No sooner was he released, he was back to eating pizza and Wendys.
  He was spoiled with his fabulous medical plan..the ones the sentators have. He never paid one dime out of pocket for anything. And he had me. I can't help but wonder if he didn't have the cadillac plan of all cadillacs  and me if he would have been more compliant.
  My mother is another one, doesn't want to do what the docs say. Now she is in a home and they hide her pills in her food. She complies now, because she has no choice. I am so done being taken for granted, that you can stick a fork in me.
  I spoiled both of them rotten and I've lived to regret it big time. I didn't know how to parent my parents then, but I do now. I learned the hard way. I now say no, no matter what my mother wants and I don't care how much she begs and cries.
  My parents trained me to cater to them. No more...for I have seen the light and realize how foolish I was.
  My Aunts are next on my list. They want info, well they will have to go visit my mother (and I know that is never happenin) or I will not tell them what they want to know. They call her once every 4-5 weeks ....big deal. I've spoiled my Aunts too...dumb arse me. Well dumb arse no more. It's always what I have I done for them lately.

30840.12,"Hi, Megan, welcome to the forum.

Your father has a lot of living left to do.  Dry your eyes, take a deep breath, and help him live life to its fullest.

Since the diagnosis is pretty recent, you may find the Newly Diagnosed article helpful:
http://www.alzcompend.info/?p=121

I suspect that the changes you're seeing in your father, now that he's on AD meds, are real.  My husband responded very positively to Namenda and to huperzine A (another cholinesterase inhibitor similar to Aricept).

Many of us have found that our loved ones also benefited from a new, prescription-only ""medical food"", Axona:
http://www.about-axona.com
So ... you might want to check into that.

There are other things that can be done to slow down the emergence of symptoms and help your father have a good quality of life, including:

(1) Sticking as closely as you can to a Mediterranean diet, which has been shown to help prevent/delay the onset of ""mild cognitive impairment (MCI)"" and AD, and also slow their progression.

Basically, it involves:
- High intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, and cereals
- High intake of unsaturated fatty acids (mostly in the form of olive oil)
- Low intake of saturated fatty acids
- Moderately high intake of fish
- Low-to-moderate intake of dairy products (mostly cheese or yogurt)
- Low intake of meat and poultry
- A regular but moderate amount of ethanol, primarily in the form of wine and generally during meals

To that, I would add eating a quarter cup of nuts every day -- quite a few studies have found they're very good for you.

Also, olive oil is very good for salad dressings etc, but not so much so for cooking especially at higher temps. Use canola oil for that, or a mix of the two. (I've seen plenty of products that contain olive and canola oils.)

Avoid hydrogenated fats and trans fats like the plague.

(2) Lots of physical exercise.

(3) Lots of exercise for the brain -- activities that involve learning something new.  I've seen some reports that learning new things coupled with using a computer can be particularly helpful.

(4) Socialization, doing things with friends and family.

(5) Plenty of rest.

(6) NO SMOKING!!! and avoid air pollution as much as possible.

(7) Do whatever you can do to minimize stress in your father's life ... and help your father learn and practice stress reduction techniques.  Many of us can confirm that stress exacerbates cognitive dysfunction; and researchers are beginning to think that prolonged, severe stress can actually trigger AD.

And last, but definitely not least, your father may want to consider participating in a clinical trial.  There are many promising new drugs coming down the pipeline, and a clinical trial is a way to get access to them before they become available to the general public.  We'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about trials.  My husband has been in two.

42058.7,"It's difficult to explain to someone who hasn't observed it, but there's absolutely nothing anyone or any device can do to help my husband not fall. When the appropriate synapses are firing properly, he can get up out of a chair and walk around and then go back and sit down. When things aren't working properly, nothing will help him. Cane, walker, physical therapy exercises, even someone standing near him coaching him to 'sit' or 'stand' will do no good. It's not a matter of muscles, it's a matter of the connection between brain and muscles. When he is on automatic, there are still movements he can do successfully. But that cannot be depended upon.

When I was still trying to get him into our truck or trying to manage him around the house getting into his chair or out of it, I could sometimes bypass the confused part of his brain and go to the automatic part. If I wanted to get him out of his chair and he was stalled and couldn't get up, I'd walk away for a few minutes and then bustle back in like I was going some place important and walk up to him briskly and say something like, ""OK, babe, let's take off now."" and grab him by the arm. Many times he would hop to his feet and start walking. But if he had to think about it... forget it.

I'm not trying to be negative or discouraging, just a little info. The key danger for us was him not being able to consistently get up and walk and he just kept falling more and more.

Others with more experience will join in but I can suggest you call your local Alzheimer's office or State Area on Aging...they should be able to direct you.
In my State, I believe the only 2 options for getting ""paid"" as a care giver are:
-You can apply for assistance through our State Medicaid system..they have specifics on qualifying.
-If your LO qualifies for VA Aid and Assistance ...was your Mom or Dad in the service during a Wartime? My Mom was, but Mom's can qualify also from a husband's service. This would be a stipend to your Mom...but you could use for her care ( by you). There is also something called ""Family Caregiver Stipend""...also thru the Aid and Attendance...I am not familiar with the specifics on that .
Not everyone can afford to do this, but I made the decision to go out on FMLA this month. You may want to see if your company provides this . It give me 12 weeks ( you can take that intermittently or continuously) to stay home ( part of which I take my paid time off) , a position must be held for you , and your company must continue to pay for their share of your health insurance. Maybe this would help you in some way ? For me, I am retiring at the end of the year anyway, so it gets me closer to that.

  Iris - My mom thinks she is fine so how do I explain why someone is helping her, be it me, my brother or a companion?  How do I know it is time for help, because she is making poor food choices?  
      Kelly, I'm glad you asked that question.  Your mom thinks she is fine because she has anosognosia.  This is a characteristic of the dementias in which the PWD (person with dementia) is unaware of having dementia.  She truly believes she is fine.  She doesn't see any need for help and she most likely, never will.  You will have to use work-arounds to get things done, along with learning new ways of communicating.  Learn from the members.  Do not use the terms ""dementia"" or ""Alzheimer's"".  Try to make your mom the hero.  Don't tell her that she needs help; let her believe that she is helping out a person who is down on her luck and needs some hours of work to get by.  Or use a variation of that story.


Your mom appears to be passed early stage.  Read the online reading material which has great information and read a lot of threads.  Here is information about anosognosia.

  She hates her body which has changed so much in the last year.  She has ""shrunk"" 2 inches this year, gained 10+ pounds.  Her CT Scan this week showed a small umbilical hernia - a decent finding... should be minimally invasive procedure to address the pain she feels.  She was hoping it would find something to explain why she just gains weight, can't fit in any of her old clothes & all of her lab tests keep returning with worse results.
  AND here is where I ""churn"".... her PCP keeps pushing us on low fat/healthy eating and exercise to address the weight gain, severe fatty liver they found in a recent ultrasound, rising triglycerides, rising blood glucose (pre-diabetes) & elevated liver function.  The crux- mom always ate well & exercised a lot, even walking miles daily up until the day of her stroke.  But, now she has little stamina, hates being cold and can't always ""remember"" to say no to a dessert, a piece of bread, etc.
  In November we changed breakfast to just oatmeal & yogurt (she loves that!) ...she walks as much as she can (if it's not too cold out & not raining), participates in the daily (chair) exercise program in her MC and I go daily to encourage even longer walks, weather permitting.   We may join the local community center to use their inside walking track for poor weather days.  I plan to meet with the MC staff to see if there is more we can do on the diet side.  It seems nothing we do really makes an impact.  Is her PCP right?  Should we be putting diet & exercise as #1 priority?  Are there other meds that can help with her stamina? 
  She does love her food...she can't say no to a dessert, lunch out day at MC...and should she?  There are so few moments of joy for her.  Most days she doesn't remember what she ""shouldn't"" eat.  She's the ""good"" girl that cleans her plate. 
  I feel like I should bring her home to live with me ... I could cook super healthy for her, watch the sweets, walk several times throughout the day.  I know I can't do the socialization, memory care activities as well as her current placement.....
  I read so often on this board that others are challenged with making sure their LO eat.  Does anyone else face this weight & exercise dilemma and Dr. advice?  Any advice on how important the diet and exercise is vs. the MC?  I'm so torn on what to do.....
  Thanks for any advice...sorry this is so long.....

Aside from living in Memory Care you could be talking about me.  I used to be active and fit.  I developed hypothyroidism and gained weight (a lot of weight), lost my stamina.  Now I don't care to exercise, although I do push myself.  I was diagnosed as diabetic but reversed that dx with diet and exercise.

Your mom is going through changes common at this stage of life--post menopause, losing height due to loss of estrogen, hypothyroid and pre-diabetic.  Fortunately, diet and exercise are the treatments for managing these conditions, with medications added as indicated.  The treatment (not cure) for dementia involves following the Mediterrean diet and vigorous exercise to tolerance. 

Has your mom been evaluated by a registered dietician to determine specifically what changes she may need?   There are specific changes necessary for a hypothyroid patient, for a pre-diabetic patient, for an osteopenic patient, and for a patient with fatty liver.  All of these specifics can be modified for a Mediterrean diet.

Don't try to guess at the diet or let the facility's chef guess.  An RD can tell you exactly what and how much your mom should eat for her conditions.  The doctor should order a visit to a dietician.

Has your mom had a bone density scan?  This is important to assess her bone loss.

The memory care facility should be able to provide the diet your mom needs, which is most likely similar for many patients in her age group.  You can bring in supplemental dishes and keep an eye on what is provided by the facility. 

A good diet and exercise program will help anyone.  The problem is compliance.  It takes a while for people to feel the benefits of being diligent in their program and many lose motivation.  Your mom will need much encouragement.  But don't encourage to the point where all enjoyment in life is gone.

When I read the title of your post I thought I should read it, as my mother had narcolepsy most of her adult life.  Narcolepsy meaning a chronic neurological disorder, for which she took medication.  In her case, it was coupled with cataplexy.  She never had dementia, and died at 65 of cancer.
In your situation, you are dealing with vascular dementia, that is (in your words) advanced.  MPSunshine and MacyRose have given you great information about having her medications evaluated by a qualified physician. And there's nothing wrong with some decent blood work to rule out a host of causes, as well as the standard issue of infections or a UTI.   That's where I'd start.  
My father had both AD and vascular dementia.  And what many of us would tell you, is that as this disease progresses you will see increased sleeping and lethargic behavior.  Towards the end, it seemed that's all dad did was sleep.   I think we've all seen our LO fall asleep during a meal.  And rising from a sitting position can be difficult for even healthy elderly people.  (Have to mention, that if she is on a blood pressure medication, her dosage might also need to be looked at.)

I wish I could say something here to make you feel better and at ease. What you describe is the never ending struggle to try to stay ahead of the situation as Alzheimer's slowly erases the minds of our loved ones. It seems to come on slow and then all at once we wake up and discover so much of our time is spent dealing with Alzheimer's problems.
A few years ago I was in the same spot where you now are, I was trying hard to share life, duties, and experiences with my wife. But just like your husband by wife created more problems while helping me then it was worth. Little by little I found I was taking over more and more of her tasks and as you, I did not have enough time to get lot of things done or in some cases even started. As the years rolled by I learned to set priorities and had to just let some tasks fall by the wayside as my wife needed more personal care and support from me.
In time it reached the point were all my time was consumed taking her to doctor appointments, preparing her food, dressing her, cleaning her clothes, bathing her, and cleaning up messes she made in the bathroom and sometimes on the bedroom rug. It reached the point where I was unable to get enough sleep because of her being awake all hours of the night. And I could see that in time my health would start failing if I did not find the time to take care of myself. Also at this point the house was becoming a pig pen and was in need of some basic cleaning.
I decided that I had to place her in an assisted memory care home which I had been putting off since it is so costly. I went ahead and placed her in a care home even thou in time it will use up all our savings that we had put away for our later life. But now I am again free to work on needed tasks and keep my life in a more normal manner. I spend a lot of time visiting her in the home but I know she is getting the care she needs and I am not tied down by her Alzheimer's problems now day. Yes, I am alone now without her around the house but the last year she was living here with me I was pretty much alone then too as she no longer knew who I was, she had no interest in anything, she could still talk but we could not have any meaningful discussions, and she just seemed to want to lay in bed all day long which I knew was not good for her.
All I can say is this is going to be a learning journey for you with lot of new experiences along the way. There are many of us on this same journey with you so come cry on our shoulder when ever you feel the need. We can all feel your discomfort and stress as lot of us have already been there or are right now walking in your footsteps along this journey with you. Do not feel guilty about not getting some tasks done, seeing that your husband is safe and content is what will be your most important task while you are on this journey with all of us.

     Finally in April 2013 the final straw broke and he forced her to go and of course got the diagnosis.

I took her to the vet because my husband was irritated to the point he wanted to have her euthanized.  The vet put her on a drug called Anipryl which had only recently come out on the market.  I gave her the first dose the next morning and change was absolutely remarkable.  She calmed down and actually jumped up on the sofa and sat next to me in a very relaxed way - something she had NEVER done even as a young dog!  She became very affectionate and the pacing stopped immediately and that night she was happy and relaxed in her crate again.  She went on to live 4 more happy years, although in the end, she had urinary incontinence when she was sleeping, which I just managed by changing the blankets in her crate everytime I let her out of her crate and making sure she only slept on the dog lounge not my furniture and bathing her frequently.  Other than that she seemed essentially normal, had a good appetite, and seemed to be enjoying her old age. 
  The human version of Anipryl is selegiline hydrochloride.  The results of using this for the treatment of Alzheimer's have been equivocal - open to interpretation.  But if it were my relative and they had symptoms similar to my dog's, I'd ask the doctor about trying the medicine simply because I had such a remarkable experience with it.

The story of you falling in the pond was scary!  I would never be found these days. At least you learned your lesson when your husband was there to help. I bet you won't do that again. I did chuckle at the pants coming off, as it reminded me of a story that happened at my other farm. 
 The farm is on the flight path of the small municipal airport a half mile away. They have a rather large, busy sky diving business over there. We were always getting some skydivers landing on our farm.  This particular day, only me and the elderly farm worker were on the farm by ourselves.  I notice a parachute coming fast out of the sky, then it folded up and hit the ground way out in my hay field.  I yelled for Linwood and we hurried out on the gator and saw nothing. I stood up and starting yelling ""HELLO, Hello"" and Linwood looked at me and casually said.' UM,  ms Joan, I don't think he will answer!  I panicked and sped up to the barn and called 911. About the time several fire trucks arrived at the farm driveway, so did the van from the sky dive company. They told us that the chute we saw, was the failed one and he had pulled the back up chute and made it almost to the airport before they picked him up.
Anyway, they called me later and asked if he could come out there to look for the lost chute. We found it in the pond and he said he had to retrieve it. It was just me and him out there. I told him the pond was very muddy and had snapping turtles in it. He said, he had no choice but to retrieve it. So with me standing there, he starts unbuckling his pants and drops them right there and jumped into the pond. The only thing I could say was 'You go boy"" You just made this old ladies day!!!

2676.3,"Hello John and a warm welcome to you.  I can well understand your deep concern as well as how difficult this must be for your mother.  This is a challenge that exists over the 24 hour continuum and is no small thing.
From what you have written, it appears that your mother is still functioning at a high enough level that she can lip read.  Has she ever used or can she now use a technical device to type communication or a white erase board to communicate back and forth in writing?   Certainly not optimal and probably something you have alreadly assessed, but I thought I would ask.
If your mother has assets to pay for such a service, is there someone who can be with her during the as a paid companion who is skilled with ASL?  Sometimes there are aides that work through agencies who are skilled in sign language as they have a family member who is deaf.  This would take a lot of calls to different agencies that provide aides to see if that is an option.
Another call that can be made would be to the local Ombudsman's Office.  They do oversight for NHs when there are concerns or complaints  and they are knowledgable about all area NHs.  They may have some insight.  Each NH must post the number for the Ombudsman's Office for clients and families to see; but Google would be efficient in providing the Ombudsman's number for your area.
The next best thing would be to make contacts with a variety agencies specific for deaf individuals as one of them or more may be knowledable about facilities in your area that have sign language capability with staff.
 One can start by calling the Alzheimer's Assn. Helpline at (800) 272-3900 and asking for a Care Consultant.  There are no fees for this assistance and Consulants are highly educated Social Workers who specialize in dementia and family dynamics.  They may have some referrals.
You mention you are in Maryland; if you have not already done so, you may want to contact the agencies in Maryland and others who may have some insight or even referrals:
Governer's Office For Deaf and HOH:   https://odhh.maryland.gov/senior-citizens/
Maryland Deaf Senior Citizens Org.: http://mddeafseniors.org/
National Assn. For The Deaf, (they have listings of assisted living facilities in states and maybe calling one of those facilities will have information about NHs that have assistance for the deaf):  https://www.nad.org/resources/directories/senior-resources/
Deaf and Hard of Hearing Resources in Maryland:
https://dors.maryland.gov/consumers/specialized/deaf/Pages/default.aspx
There are more contacts listed on Google; hopefully, it will lead to success.
The ADA requirements re mandated communication with the deaf is law; but it does not provide for 24/7 interpreters; the National Assn. for the Deaf has a good writing explaining the law and how it applies to care facilities and they DO have responsibility:

3776.3,"Hello Erin and welcome.   Are you caring for someone with dementia?  If so, can you tell us a little about yourself and the person you are caring for; that helps us to get to know you better.
I did do a search using what you posted and found that this entity has multiple online links. From what I have seen, this appears to me to be just one more of those programs that may have no solid proven scientific validity within the scope of what would be done with large scientific studies done over time by valid researchers and those researchers would not be into private marketing.   What I saw with this entity is that they have many links online and all of them seem to lead one to one place . . . . connecting for sales.
While we all have hoped, it is fact that there is no ""cure,"" or reversals; one cannot totally reverse and restore a Loved One (LO) to their prior healthy brain.  If this were true; why my goodness, this would be the hugest celebration in international news all over the world.  In the U.S., the National Institute of Health,  the Centers for Disease Control, the newspapers, the TV news shows would be heralding this loudly for days upon days . . . . . it would be the most heralded bit of news and international awards would be bestowed.  In fact, the White House would probably have announcements and ceremonys.
I am sorry.  We who have been around see this sort of marketing dynamic from time to time and it all has ended up  in a similar place with caregivers finding their pocketbooks a little more empty.
You are a very consciencious person in regard to your LO with dementia; that is good.   I would like to offer you the direct phone number to the National Alzheimer's Assn. Helpline at (800) 272-3900 where you can gain accurate information.   There are no fees for this service.  If you do call, please ask to speak to a Care Consultant.  They are highly educated Social Workers who specialize in dementia and who can assist you with information regarding this item; they can offer support in many ways as you move through this journey, and can assist with problem solving and have much information as need be. 
Keeping a LO with routine and structure is the best way to format their environment.  Eating a mediterranean diet and getting exercise and sufficient sleep helps some persons with dementia at the earlier stages and some may slow the progression of the disease for awhile. Having a dementia specialist as part of the care team is essential.
For some types of dementia, (there are multiple different kinds), there are medications that can for some people, some of the time, slow down the inevitable losses a bit, or even assist in moderately improving function for awhile.  While this helps some, it does not for everyone and it does not last.  One must have an accurate diagnosis for type of dementia present made by a dementia specialist as some meds for one type of dementia can be contraindicated in another and even make things worse  It is a balancing act in which one size does not fit all. 
I am sorry that this may possibly not be what you were hoping for, but it is up to you whether you decide to explore this or not and whether you wish to purchase the offerings that you will in all probability receive.   From my personal experience, you may have been given the ""teaser,"" and may find yourself led onto a sales page.  Sometimes amazing claims will be made.  As that old saying goes, Caveat Emptor:  ""Let The Buyer Beware,""

  As a nurse, I can totally understand your need for help!  Fortunately, with my dear hubby, we are not at that stage yet.
  The range of services depends so much on where you live!!
A few questions may direct your further inquiry. . .
  1. Is he old enough for Medicare? If so, SOME limited homecare services may be covered (often requiring a hospital stay first!).
  2. By any chance does he have Long Term Care insurance?  Now would be the time to use it!
  3. Is there a Parish Nurse/Block Nurse/Living-at-Home/ program in your area?? These grant-funded programs can often provide at least some help for you in your home.
  4. How big iscyour house?? Would you be able/willing to share it with a caregiver?
I have built a ""mother-in-law suite"" in our lower level fully anticipating the day when I will need to have someone else living with us to help with my husband's care.
  For most ""free"" care, you have to qualify by having a fairly LOW income. 
  Perhaps a neighborhood or community service group would be willing to offer some ""hands-on"" service that would be of value (churches, senior centers, scouting groups, etc.??).

  My sister, who has Down Syndrome, AD, and Parkinson's, was placed on Keppra for seizures last summer.  Her muscles had been weakening as it was, so it's hard to tell with her if the Keppra weakened them more.  You have to have your blood checked every so often while on Keppra to make sure it doesn't lower your white blood count.  When they did the blood work on her, her body did not appear to even be absorbing the Keppra properly, as it barely showed in her system and her white count was down to 2600, so they stopped it all together. 
  I did note that you need to be on Keppra for one month and then some side effects go away. 
  For my sister, the Keppra did not work at all.  However, keep in mind the medical community is finding that aging Down Syndrome don't necessarily react the same to medications as people who do not have Down Syndrome.

Then, a year later, your mother has a paralyzing stroke and it becomes necessary to put her in a nursing home at a cost of $8,000 per month. She no longer has any money of her own to pay for this. You then find out your three siblings have unfortunately taken their $50,000 and used the money to buy new cars, put a child through college or pay down their mortgages. That leaves your mom with only the $50,000 she gave you to pay for the nursing home fees. At $8,000 per month, she'd be able to pay for only 6 months before coming up short. And she would not be eligible for Medicaid because she'd given away $200,000 only a year before--money she could have spent on her own care rather than asking the government to pay for it.

Maybe that wouldn't happen in your family. But that's not a risk that I was personally willing to take. I had to wrap my head around the fact that neither I or any of my siblings would get a dime when my mom passed away, and that I was going to have to use all my dad's hard earned money to pay for Mom's care. But it's her money, and it should be used for her needs. Better to play by the rules where Medicaid is concerned rather than take a risk and find out you've messed up big-time. I thought about trusts, etc. but decided to just pay for things as we needed to and then apply for Medicaid when Mom got down to her last few thousand dollars (in my state the asset limit is $4,000). My parents didn't have hundreds of thousands of dollars to worry about in the first place, so I didn't want to complicate matters.",0,1

The kids could pop in and out (like your sibs) and keep an eye on him. Nobody, *especially* him, thought he needed 24-hr. Supervision.
Long story short, everything would be fine for 2-3 days. But if I was gone longer, he “went downhill” very fast. I don’t know if he ran out of steam, or if the extended break in his routine was too much for him, but the effects were the same. He fell apart very fast. What worked for a couple days did not work for a week. Even they could see—although they first thought he’d be fine—and they ended up taking him to their homes. 
He did not like it, but my best understanding is they gave him no choice and at that point he could not really refuse.
(None of that speaks to any real emergency that can happen in minutes, whether someone is away for one hour or one week)
You decide your level of risk, and you undoubtedly have to go, just as I did....all I can suggest is that the sibs be on alert, and be ready to take him to their home or stay in his, or get a caregiver (??) Just be prepared, be ready to adjust if needed.

Hang in there, you can do this but please don't be afraid to ask for help. Also, if someone offers, take it. Don't be stubborn like I was. The driving was one of the hardest issues. Make sure keys are hidden well and watch the set in your purse. I learned this the hard way. It will take time but eventually they will forget they can drive. Sad but a relief. For anger issues which I never thought would get better but did, I put my H on Seroquel and increased as necessary. He is now on 400mg and anger issues have subsided, finally. Did take a few months but it did happen. Also, you will learn what triggers it and ways to avoid. Get yourself on a antidepressant asap. Paxil has saved my life. This journey is not easy but you can do it. It is amazing the strength we find. Good luck and stay strong. Also, stay on this board. It is another lifesaver.

Let me try again with all care.  Your income could have been so low that you were EACH qualified for medicare. You could have both changed income and circumstances and BOTH became ineligible.  the change in January only affected him.  He may be reeligible as medically needy.

A very profound statement that if more Caregivers admitted to it a lot more Caregivers would be relieved that they have recognized the future which has stong bearing on the present.
  From the description you give about your Mom inserting herself into the TV programs it is my estimation that your Mom is not ready for termination, that is, unless she has a body organ failure in the development. I have watched several Hospice patients pass and when they are ready to go the end is a lot more apparent. However, Mom's lack of desire to swallow follows a near Hospice need.  
   Hospice is an aid and bringing in Hospice will not harm, and may also help you with their opinions.",0,1
2332.1,"I am so glad you reached out to the board. I don't know if I have anything super profound to share, but I will at least tell you a few things that I did to help me not be as emotionally charged and weepy as I was in the beginning. Counseling - didn't love the person, but appreciated working through The Grief Recovery Handbook, which helped deal with anticipatory grief. I was able to separate my mom and my relationship with her into Mom1 and Mom2 (kind of a pre and post dementia thing). It helped me realize that things will never be the same and it allowed me to grieve for Mom1 and embrace Mom2.
Two things I did on my own to help me process all of my emotions were to write an Ode to Alzheimer's (which helped me rage at the disease and not my loved one) and to develop my own personal ABC's of Caregiving (needed something positive to focus on). Both were incredibly therapeutic for me and helped get me in a better place. Know that we are all struggling and we can get a lot of strength and support from each other. I will leave you with my ABC's, hoping it might help you in some small way.
My ABC’s of Caregiving

Appreciate the little things
Be in the moment
Celebrate what is possible
Do what feels right
Extend love
Forgive yourself
Get to know the ‘new’ person
Hold on to what works for you and let the rest go
Ignite passion
Jump into their world
Kick up your self-care
Let go of hurtful comments
Make new memories
Name your feelings
Open up to others
Prepare for next steps, but don’t obsess about ‘what if...’
Question everything you don’t understand from authority figures
Resist carrying the burden alone
Simply be present
Talk with others who are traveling on this same path
Understand some things are totally out of your control
Value your incredible worth as a caregiver
Wallow when needed, but don’t let it own you
Xhale deeply
Yell in your head, but not at your loved one
Zero in on one good thing, no matter how small, from each and every day",1,1
27137.2,"I am under the belief (as I have seen this with my mom) that people with AD can have a better quality of life when they get to socialize with others, are involved in daily activities, do physical exercises if they are capable. 
  What is a typical day like for your dad?  If he doesn't do much, then maybe you can use the above argument with your mom ... that your dad's abilities may somewhat improve - or not decline as quickly - if he had more things going on. And, that would require him going some place outside of the home.

Iris - thank you for the information you researched and provided.  We've always considered my sister to have Young Onset Alz.  However, we recently changed doctors and he asked if she had ever been considered to have FTD.  While it doesn't change the eventual outcome, I understand it does not have as high of a hereditary factor as YOA.  I do worry about my children and other family members so that would be helpful to know for certain.

Player of the year! I hope your daughter felt great joy and how proud you are of her. Congrats!
Conversations.....90% of DH communication is in the form of questions. LOTS or questions! Kind of like “why is the sky blue” kind of questions. Questions that really don't have solid answers.

Sometimes it is just really hard to push the feelings down.",1,1
38692.2,"I applaud you for even considering the idea of taking care of your ex. But, you have to remember, she has dementia. She is no longer capable of making sound decisions. Your son is taking advantage of that fact. Your ex needs to be rescued from that situation. She CANNOT do it herself. You need to give your son an ultimatum, not his impaired mother. He can get a job or become homeless. It's up to him now. Mom is no longer involved. Period. And then get her the heck away from him. Don't allow him to contact her or vice versa.

But, if you are going to care for her, you need to have her assign you as her power of attorney for both finances and health care. You should see an elder care attorney for this. If you think you can't afford an attorney, well, it's probably cheaper than what your son was taking from her. The $900 was likely just the tip of the iceberg.

    The audiologist had the same issue with her 90- something dad, and decided not to fit him with hearing aids.  We ended up doing the same.  Mom has a TV she can turn up really loud, and a hearing assist phone.  She has great difficulty learning new information, and I honestly don' t think she could learn to use the hearing aids. They cost around $4,000 which they would have to pay out of pocket. 
    My dad with AD has had his hearing aids for about 10 years, and he still remembers  how to put them in and change the batteries.  I am hoping we can keep them going as long as possible.
